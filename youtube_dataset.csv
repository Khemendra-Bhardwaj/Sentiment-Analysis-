"""Shape Of You""

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (mmmm)
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mmmm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now (mmmm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date (mmmm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (mmmm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay (mmmm)
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body

"lyrics:
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

We push and pull like a magnet do

I'm in love with your body

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (See you in a better place)
Uh

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & (Wiz Khalifa)]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (Yeah, we came a long way) from where we began
(You know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home",2019-11-22T15:55:49Z,6003

"I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Get ready cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar

Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You're gonna hear me roar

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar...

Ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

"Thus says the Lord God:

 “In those days people will no longer say,
‘The parents have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.
Instead, everyone will die for their own sin; whoever eats sour grapes—their own teeth will be set on edge.
Jeremiah 31: 29-30

""Therefore this is what the Lord says: ‘I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them"".
Jeremiah 11:11

"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh
So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

"Most of people who listen to this songs everyday are like this :
= Heart broken
= Depressed
= No Friends
= No love from loved ones
= Going to bed at late nights
= Introverts
= Cannot share anything to anyone
= Thinking about future
= Destroying their dreams because of their family situations
= Pain in heart 
= Crying at late nights

Still we have courage and hope .

"lyrics :
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, no more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars
Yeah, we'll be countin' stars
I see this life like a swingin' vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashin' signs
Seek it out and ye shall find
The old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told
I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, no more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, no more countin' dollars, we'll be
We'll be countin' stars
Hey, yeah
I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
The hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told
And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, no more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, no more countin' dollars, we'll be
We'll be countin' stars
Oh
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep

"Jesus is coming soon!!!!
BELIEVE IN HIM RIGHT NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!!!!
A - Admit you're a sinner.
""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."" - Romans 3:23 (KJV)
We were all born sinners, that's why we must be born again spiritually to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
B - Believe Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior
""That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation."" - Romans 10:9-10 (KJV) This scripture is tying into the belief of the Gospel of Grace (1 Corinthians 15:1-4).
C - Call Upon the Name of the Lord
None of us are perfect, that is why we need Jesus in our lives. ""As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one."" - Romans 3:10 (KJV)
But Romans 10:13 states that ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.""",2020-09-08T02:19:17Z,1

¡Felicidades eres digno de escuchar esta canción en 2020 admitelo tu lo buscaste!
Bailando bailandooo!!!",2020-09-07T23:23:51Z,47
"Letra en español:
Yo te miro, se me corta la respiración
Cuanto tu me miras se me sube el corazón
(Me palpita lento el corazon)
Y en silencio tu mirada dice mil palabras
La noche en la que te suplico que no salga el sol
(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)
Tu cuerpo y el mio llenando el vacío
Subiendo y bajando (subiendo y bajando)
(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)
Ese fuego por dentro me esta enloqueciendo
Me va saturando
Con tu física y tu química también tu anatomía
La cerveza y el tequila y tu boca con la mía
Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas) Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas)
Con esta melodía, tu color, tu fantasía
Con tu filosofía mi cabeza esta vacía
Y ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas)
Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas)

Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo
Bailar contigo, tener contigo
Una noche loca (una noche loca)
Ay besar tu boca (y besar tu boca)
Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo
Bailar contigo, tener contigo una noche loca
Con tremenda loca
(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
Tu me miras y me llevas a otra dimensión
(Estoy en otra dimensión)
Tu latidos aceleran a mi corazón
(Tu latidos aceleran a mi corazón)
Que ironía del destino no poder tocarte
Abrazarte y sentir la magia de tu olor
(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)
Tu cuerpo y el mio llenando el vacío
Subiendo y bajando (subiendo y bajando)
(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)
Ese fuego por dentro me esta enloqueciendo
Me va saturando
Con tu física y tu química también tu anatomía
La cerveza y el tequila y tu boca con la mía
Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas)
Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas)
Con esta melodía, tu color, tu fantasía
Con tu filosofía mi cabeza esta vacía
Y ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas)
Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas)
Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo
Bailar contigo, tener contigo
Una noche loca (una noche loca)
Ay besar tu boca (y besar tu boca)
Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo
Bailar contigo, tener contigo una noche loca
Con tremenda loca
(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
Ooooh bailando amor ooooh
Bailando amor ooooh es que se me va el dolor
Ooooh).",2020-08-27T11:57:16Z,95

We would walk on the sidewalk
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other

But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over

When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

All we need is somebody to lean on

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun

"I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
'Cause I'm capable of anything
Of anything and everything

Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse

Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away, don't walk away

It's in the palm of your hand now baby
It's a yes or no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it up to me
Up to me, give it up to me

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

She's a beast
I call her Karma
She eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer
Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart was on steroids
'Cause her love was so strong

You may fall in love
When you meet her
If you get the chance you better keep her
She swears by it but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon' put her in a coma

Woo! Damn I think I love her
Shawty so bad
I'm sprung and I don't care
She got me like a roller coaster
Turn the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil' mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back",2019-11-13T16:43:53Z,204

"Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
Love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dive too deep

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go
Oh oh oh no
And you let her go
Oh oh oh no

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

I know that i`ve acted stupid
But whenever i see you so far away
I wish i could play cupid

I want you so badly
This is what i`m seeking
But so sadly
Your heart is somewhere leaking

If i go the distance
I`ll be right where i belong
But it is your existence
Is all that keeps me strong

Please don`t leave me
Maybe we will find a way
I know that i have hurt you
But please i want you to stay..

love me anymore.. But i still do!

Bem, você só precisa da luz quando está queimando baixo
Só falta o sol quando começa a nevar
Só saberá que a ama quando deixar ela ir

Só saiba que você esteve alto quando estiver se sentindo baixo
Só odeio a estrada quando você está com saudades de casa
Só saberá que a ama quando deixar ela ir
E você a deixou ir

Olhando para o fundo de seu copo
Esperando que um dia você faça um sonho durar
Mas os sonhos vêm devagar e vão tão rápido

Você a vê quando fecha os olhos
Talvez um dia você entenda porque
Tudo que você toca certamente morre

Mas você só precisa da luz quando está queimando baixo
Só falta o sol quando começa a nevar
Só saberá que a ama quando deixar ela ir

Só saiba que você esteve alto quando estiver se sentindo baixo
Só odeio a estrada quando você está com saudades de casa
Só saberá que a ama quando deixar ela ir

Encarando o teto no escuro
o mesmo velho sentimento de vazio no seu coração
Porque o amor vem devagar e vai tão rápido

Bem, você a vê quando adormece
Mas nunca tocar e nunca guardar
Porque você a amava muito
E você mergulhou muito fundo

Bem, você só precisa da luz quando está queimando baixo
Só falta o sol quando começa a nevar
Só saberá que a ama quando deixar ela ir

Só saiba que você esteve alto quando estiver se sentindo baixo
Só odeio a estrada quando você está com saudades de casa
Só saberá que a ama quando deixar ela ir

E você a deixou ir
E você a deixou ir
Bem, você a deixou ir

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love",2020-09-07T13:32:50Z,1

When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

Are running out of time

[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me

They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

"When you're fine you walk away from me
Cuando estás bien te alejas de mí

You feel lonely and I'm always there
Te sientes sola y siempre estoy ahí

It's a give and take war
Es una guerra de toma y dame

Well give me what you have there
Pues dame de eso que tienes ahí

Hey baby don't be bad
Oye baby no seas mala

Do not leave me with the desire
No me dejes con las ganas

It is heard in the street
Se escucha en la calle

You do not love me anymore
Que ya no me quieres

Come tell me to my face
Ven y dímelo en la cara

Ask who you want
Pregúntale a quien tú quieras

Life, I swear that is not so
Vida, te juro que eso no es así

I never had a bad intention
Yo nunca tuve una mala intención

I never wanted to make fun of you
Yo nunca quise burlarme de ti

With me you see, you never know
Conmigo ves, nunca se sabe

One day I say no and another day yes
Un día digo que no y otro que sí

I am a masochist
Yo soy masoquista

With my body, a selfish
Con mi cuerpo, un egoísta

You are pure, pure blackmail
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje

Pure, pure blackmail
Puro, puro chantaje

It's always your way
Siempre es a tu manera

I love you even if you don't want to
Yo te quiero aunque no quieras

You are pure, pure blackmail
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje

Pure, pure blackmail
Puro, puro chantaje

You go free like the air
Vas libre como el aire

I am not yours or anyone
No soy de ti ni de nadie

How you tempt me when you move
Como tú me tientas cuando tú te mueves

That sexy move always entertains me
Ese movimiento sexy siempre me entretiene

You know how to manipulate me well with your hips
Sabes manipularme bien con tus caderas

I don't know why you have me on the waiting list
No sé porqué me tienes en lista de espera

They tell you that I'm doing and undoing
Te dicen por ahí que voy haciendo y deshaciendo

That I go out every night, that I have you there suffering
Que salgo cada noche, que te tengo ahí sufriendo

That in this relationship I am the one who commands
Que en esta relación soy yo la que mando

Don't stop at all that bad propaganda
No pares bola a toda esa mala propaganda

Pa-pa 'what do I tell you na', they eat your ear
Pa-pa'qué te digo na', te comen el oído

Do not straighten what has not been twisted
No vaya a enderezar lo que no se ha torcido

And like a madman I follow after you
Y como un loco sigo trás de tí

Dying for you
Muriendo por ti

Tell me what's there for me, baby
Dime que hay pa'mi, bebé

Than?
Qué?

Ask who you want
Pregúntale a quien tú quieras

Life, I swear that is not so
Vida, te juro que eso no es así

I never had a bad intention
Yo nunca tuve una mala intención

I never wanted to make fun of you
Yo nunca quise burlarme de ti

With me you see, you never know
Conmigo ves, nunca se sabe

One day I say no and another day yes
Un día digo que no y otro que sí

I am a masochist
Yo soy masoquista

You are pure, pure blackmail
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje

Pure, pure blackmail
Puro, puro chantaje

It's always your way
Siempre es a tu manera

I love you even if you don't want to
Yo te quiero aunque no quieras

You are pure, pure blackmail

And four years, no calls

From your roommate back in Boulder

""Believer""

First things first
I'mma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh
The way that things have been, oh ooh

Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh
The blood in my veins, oh ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

"I sent my girlfriend this song after I told her I loved her, we dated for 4 months before she got in a fatal car crash and died due to a lung puncture from one of her ribs. I played this song as she lied in the hospital bed, as the EEG beeped away. Only after 2 years I can listen to it again.

This song describes who she was, how perfect she was. 

Rest in peace 💔

Thank you everyone for the support ❤️❤️


Edit: ""Only after 2 years I can listen to it again."" This is just me rounding up,  its been 1y7m since she died, sorry for the confusion.
Anyways thank you that 800+ people are there for me, even though it appears to be nothing besides a like on a comment, It means a lot more to me :)

Edit: I checked this comment today and saw 8000 people liked it. I want this message to be out there, I'm not here for likes, I just wanted to share so maybe someone can relate and realize they aren't alone. I was in a dark place, and I'm moving on. Thank you everyone for your comfort ❤️

"My girlfriend broke up with me 2 weeks ago, she’s a hard person to forget about. I still love her. A lot. This was our homecoming song, we slow danced to this. It reminds me of her. I miss the days man...

Edit: our anniversary was coming up before she broke up with me, I was gonna sing the song on my guitar to her right after I took her to dinner, and, give her a promise ring. Guess all I have now is the ring and the song. I might try writing her a letter tho. Maybe send it on our 1 year anniversary. 
Reason we broke up is because I’m very sarcastic and she doesn’t like when I say stfu to her or whore jokingly, I can see that now, just wish I kept my mouth shut sooner",2020-09-07T02:09:49Z,198

"Lyrics : 
I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in
And follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
Darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, we're listenin' to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listenin' to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Oh, no, no
Mm

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, we're listenin' to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
No, I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight

I found a love for me
Darling just dive right in
And follow my lead
Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet 
I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me..
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love, not knowing what it was I will not give you up this time..
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own and in your eyes you're holding mine..

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listenin' to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home..
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own..
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time..
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listenin' to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, O listenin' to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserved it
You look perfect tonight.

I just heard you found the one you've been looking—
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

Don't wanna know
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you might want me to
Come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

Should've known your love was a game

There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore (We don't, we don't)
What was all of it for? (We don't, we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
Like we used to do
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed

Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

We don't talk anymore

"LYRICS
(feat. Anne-Marie & Sean Paul)

[Sean Paul:]
Call it love and devotion
Call it a mom's adoration
Foundation
A special bond of creation,
Ha

For all the single moms out there
Going through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean-da-Paul, Anne-Marie
Sing, make them hear

[Anne-Marie:]
She works at nights by the water
She's gone astray so far away
From my father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him

[Sean Paul:]
Daily struggle

[Anne-Marie:]
She tells him, ""Ooh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love.
I'm gonna give you all of my love.
Nobody matters like you.""

[Sean Paul:]
Stay up there, stay up there

[Anne-Marie:]
She tells him, ""Your life ain't gon' be nothing like my life."" (Straight!)
""You're gonna grow and have a good life.
I'm gonna do what I've got to do.""

[Sean Paul:]
Stay up there, stay up there

[Anne-Marie:]
So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Rockabye, no

[Sean Paul (Anne-Marie):]
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
(Rockabye, yeah, oh, oh)
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye

[Sean Paul (Anne-Marie):]
Single mom, how're you doing out there?
Facing the hard life without no fear (yeah)
Just so you know that you really care
'Cause any obstacle come you're well prepared (oh, no)
No, mama, you never shed tear
'Cause you have to shed things year after year
And you give the youth love beyond compare (yeah)
You find his school fee and the bus fare (yeah)
Mmm, Marie, the pops' disappear
In the wrong bar, can't find him nowhere
Steadily you work flow, everything you know
So you nah stop, no time–no time for your jeer

[Anne-Marie:]
Now she got a six-year-old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks in her eyes
He don't know he is safe

When she says, ""Ooh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love.
I'm gonna give you all of my love.
Nobody matters like you.""

[Anne-Marie (Sean Paul):]
So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
(Oh-badda-bang-bang-bang, alright then)
Rockabye, no

[Sean Paul (Anne-Marie):]
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
(Rockabye, yeah, oh, oh)
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
Rockabye, don't bother cry
Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky
Rockabye, don't bother cry
Angels surround you, just dry your eye

[Anne-Marie:]
Now she got a six-year-old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks in her eyes
He don't know he is safe when she says...

Facing the hard life without no fear
Just see and know that you really care
'Cause any obstacle come you well prepared
And no mamma you never shed tear
'Cause you haffi set things year after year
And you give the youth love beyond compare
You find the school fee and the bus fare
Hmmmm more when paps disappear
In a wrong bar can't find him nowhere
Steadily you work flow, heavily you know so you nah stop
No time no time fi a jeer

Now she gotta a six year old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep all the cold
When he looks her in the eyes
He don't know he's safe when she says

I'm gonna give you all of my love.
Nobody matters like you.""

She tells him, ""Your life ain't gon' be nothing like my life.
You're gonna grow and have a good life.

And I don't need no explanation
Cause baby, you're the boss at home

Put in work like my timesheet
She ride it like a '63
I'ma buy her new Céline
Let her ride in a foreign with me
Oh, she the bae, I'm her boo
And she down to break the rules
Ride or die, she gon' go
I'm gon' juug, she finessin'

The girl Answered with a loud angry voice; ""I don't want to spend the night with you!!
 All the people in the library started staring at the boy and he was embarrassed. 
After minutes the girl walked quietly to the guy's table and said to him I study psychology and I know what man is thinking, I guess you felt embarrassed,right?

Can we just take time and appreciate that tiktok didn't ruin this song.,2020-05-09T21:58:53Z,27975
"The song is about ""alcoholism and depression"", look at the apartment, the disorder and the things on the floor, it seems like the home of a depressed person, the dancer is totally alone, nobody accompanies her in her suffering.
The phrase ""push it down"" refers to whether or not to drink a glass.
The phrase ""Help me"" is a call for help, but it goes almost unnoticed.
The dance also has many meanings, she dances playing someone drunk and depressed, she shows all her emotions without anyone caring, no one is watching her.
The dancer (Maddie Ziegler) has her hands painted pink, this means blood from suicide attempts, the author did not want to use red to avoid being so controversial.
There is a lot of meaning in the dance, almost everything has to do with the context of the song, the rest is dance to accompany and make transitions.

At 00:12 I am a party girl, I am with a drink in my hand, do I drink it or not drink it? I push it down and I raise it again, I am undecided, I have to leave it, when will I learn?
At 00:27 she talks on the phone and is invited to go out partying, while holding a glass of wine. It is time to drink nonstop and lose your mind.
At 00:55 I am hurt, I am like a dog in a wheelchair that crawls with wheels towards the corner, but I get up with difficulty.
At 01:00 Everything has passed, now I am happy for life and without worries, everything is fine. But then I fall back from above, time to drink and do crazy things, to have a good time.
At 01:22 the stomach demands food. I'm drunk, I almost lose my balance. I say goodbye with a kiss to everyone. Nobody helps me, don't worry about me, I hold my hair myself and go.
At 01:34 it is time to sit down to eat spaghetti, I take the fork I stab it on the wall and throw it. Now I have passed out and I wake up again, I scare the flies on each side, now a cockroach climbs the wall, I clean my mouth, the food was horrible, now my stomach hurts.
At 02:01 Playing dice, I am now a gansgter. I shake and shake the bad off me, I go to a corner to cry.
At 02:24 she runs to the window but stops and turns with a scared face and backs up with trembling steps.
At 02:32 she cuts her veins in each hand and says goodbye, then she goes to the street and knocks on doors for help, nobody responds.
At 02:42 she leans against the wall, she is exhausted and depressed, she is about to fall apart. Pause the minute 02:44, it is the best scene, you can see his depressed face and his body about to fall. Then she runs jumping every obstacle on her way.
At 02:56 I open my eye, I hardly have any signs of life. The tears run down her face, she tries to commit suicide by hanging herself with the curtains, her air runs out and she says goodbye to everyone (she observes that the curtains have blood stains).
At 03:12 I am looking for someone to take refuge in, but love is not pious with me, I repress it, I repress it.
At 03:26 It is time to get up and continue pretending before everyone, I walk a tightrope and smile falsely at everyone, my face changes from happy to sad, I lie to them, I'm fine.
""Chandelier"" is about someone drunk, imagine someone who drinks until they lose their minds and don't care about anything, hangs on even a candlestick, let's live regardless of tomorrow.
The video has many more meanings than the ones I have mentioned and is fully choreographed.

Two: Don't let him in

Not excessively long to be confused with a stripper or Jehovah witness/religious  person; or too short to be confused with a lesbian or mother of  four.  (nothing wrong with  any length if that is your style)  Love her look!    The exact sexy length my hair used to be back in early  2011.  It has been  an horrific experience trying to grow it back since the weak ends nightmare began 2011/2012.  To get back to that length and longer has been a constant/ church goer disappointment.  Thank God or Buddha for people who created Lace wigs or extensions,  at least,  I can look different when I want than being forced to have a hideous short bob / natural hair or wait an eternity to grow my hair back..",2020-09-07T19:36:33Z,0

Nobody else 
Oh my love_____ 
He doesn’t love me so I’m to myself

You know he’s only calling because he’s drunk and alone
2. Don’t let him in
You’ll have to kick him out again
3. Don’t be his friend 
You know you’re gonna wake up in his bed in the morning 
And if you’re under him
You ain’t getting over him

I got new rules I countin’ 
(High Pitched H. P.) I got new rules I countin’
(H.P) I gotta tell em’ to myself
(HP) I got new rules I countin’

I’m to myself
I do. I DO! I DOOO!

1. Don’t pick up the phone
You know he’s only calling because he’s drunk and alone

Got new... x2 (fades)
Eat sleep and breathing

Because I...
Got new... (fades)

"I love this song, it's super catchy, I didn't know it was by Dua Lipa, in fact, before I met her, that song had appeared on TV and I said what an incredible song and I sang it ALL the good time Well, two years passed and I met Dua Lipa and her voice seemed to me that I had already heard her so I had a hunch and I started looking for the song like crazy. I found her and realized that they were the the same girl and well now I adore her although I don't listen to her music so much and that was the story of how I met Dua Lipa. 👁️👄👁️ Half complicated the matter",2020-09-07T21:17:42Z,1

I  told him about my wife troubles and he told me that my wife must be cured from this fibroid, so he prepared a herbal medicine for my wife which she used for 3 weeks and everything was like a dream for my wife.

Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time
What do you mean?
Oh oh oh what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You're so indecisive, what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy, or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, making love all night
First you're up and you're down and then between
Oh I really want to know
What do you mean? ooh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Oh oh oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can't win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start won't let this end
First you wanna go to the left then you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day make love all night
First you up and you're down then between
Oh I really want to know
What do you mean? ooh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? (oh what do you mean?) hey
When you don't want me to move

Said you're running out of time
What do you mean? (ah baby)
Oh oh oh what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean? ooh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? (you're so confusing baby)
Hey, when you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean? (oh be more straightforward)

At the age of 15 I’ve listened to all of Em’s songs and have all of his albums. I have them all on DVD’s and have copies on iTunes. He’s my idol and one day I hope to be like him. My dad was a musician but didn’t make it far then turned to alcohol and drugs. He took all the money in my savings account that was gonna be for college and used it on girls and drugs. Please let my story get far. This means a lot. Lots of people say things about my talent. I don’t drop there. I play sports so maybe I can get a scholarship to college for basketball and football in case I don’t make it in the music industry.,2020-09-07T22:03:55Z,33

"LYRICS 

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me
And I love it, wait
Where you going? I'm leaving you
No you ain't, come back
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude?
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face,
Spewing venom in your words, when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over it controls you both
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie",2020-08-28T20:59:13Z,107

Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face,
Spewing venom in your words, when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over it controls you both
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

At the age of 15 I’ve listened to all of Em’s songs and have all of his albums. I have them all on DVD’s and have copies on iTunes. He’s my idol and one day I hope to be like him. My dad was a musician but didn’t make it far then turned to alcohol and drugs. He took all the money in my savings account that was gonna be for college and used it on girls and drugs. Please let my story get far. This means a lot. Lots of people say things about my talent. I don’t drop there. I play sports so maybe I can get a scholarship to college for basketball and football in case I don’t make it in the music industry.,2020-09-07T22:03:55Z,47

"Hey Im the Lyrics Guy 😁

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me
And I love it, wait
Where you going? I'm leaving you
No you ain't, come back
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude?
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face,
Spewing venom in your words, when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over it controls you both
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie",2020-08-29T14:46:17Z,47

I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie",2020-08-28T20:59:13Z,110

"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me
And I love it, wait
Where you going? I'm leaving you
No you ain't, come back
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude?
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face,
Spewing venom in your words, when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over it controls you both
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano

"Thus says the Lord God:

 “In those days people will no longer say,
‘The parents have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.
Instead, everyone will die for their own sin; whoever eats sour grapes—their own teeth will be set on edge.
Jeremiah 31: 29-30

""Therefore this is what the Lord says: ‘I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them"".

"letra: 
Cuatro abrazos y un café
Apenas me desperté
Y al mirarte recordé
Que ya todo lo encontré
Tu mano en mi mano
De todo escapamos
Juntos, ver el sol caer
(Let them enjoy the Paradise)
Vamos pa' la playa, pa’ curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, tú eres buscabulla y me gusta
Lento y contento
Cara al viento
Lento y contento
Cara al viento
(Farru)
Y aprovecha que el sol 'tá caliente
Y vamo' a disfrutar el ambiente
Vámono’ a meternos pa'l agua
Pa' que veas qué rico se siente
Y vámono' en tropical
Por to'a la costa a chinchorrear
De chinchorro a chinchorro
Paramo' a darno' una Medalla

Bien fría pa' bajar la sequía
Un poco de Bob Marley
Y unos tragos ’e sangría
Pa’ que te sueltes
Poco a poquito
Porque pa' vacilar
No hay que salir de Puerto Rico
Y dale lento
Date un shot de Coquito
Y como dice Fonsi
Vamo’ a darle despacito
Pa' que te suelte'
Poco a poquito
Porque pa' vacilar
No hay que salir de Puerto Rico
Vamos pa’ la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, tú eres buscabulla
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, baby, tú estás dura y me gusta
Lento y contento
Cara al viento
Lento y contento
Cara al viento
Y darle lento, meterle violento
Te puse reggaeton pa' que me apagues ese cuerpo
Métele hasta abajo, está duro ese movimiento
El único testigo que tenemos aquí e' el viento
Y dale, métele cintura
Mátame con tu hermosura
Mira cómo me frontea
Porque sabe que está dura

Calma, mi vida, con calma
Que nada hace falta
Si estamos juntitos andando
Calma, mi vida, con calma
Que nada hace falta
Si estamos juntitos bailando
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, tú eres buscabullas
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, baby, tú estás dura
Y me gusta

"WAKE ME UP - AVICII
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
feeling my way through the darkness
guided by a beating heart
i can't tell where the journey will end
but i know where to start
they tell me i'm too young to understand
they say i'm caught up in a dream
well life will pass me by if i don't open up my eyes
well that's fine by me

so wake me up when it's all over
when i'm wiser and i'm older
all this time i was finding myself
and i didn't know i was lost

so wake me up when it's all over
when i'm wiser and i'm older
all this time i was finding myself
and i didn't know i was lost

i tried carrying the weight of the world
but i only have two hands
i hope i get the chance to travel the world
and i don't have any plans
i wish that i could stay forever this young
not afraid to close my eyes
life's a game made for everyone
and love is a prize

so wake me up when it's all over
when i'm wiser and i'm older
all this time i was finding myself
and i didn't know i was lost

so wake me up when it's all over
when i'm wiser and i'm older
all this time i was finding myself
and i didn't know i was lost

i didn't know i was lost

In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better

I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different

Better than he can

Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time

"LYRICS
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything.

Uh!
I'm gonna kick my feet up
Then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't

I'll be lounging on the couch,
Just chillin' in my snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man

Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all!
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh

Tomorrow I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out: 'This is Great' (Oh my God, this is great)
Yeah

I might mess around, get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait
Haha

Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all",2020-09-05T16:54:41Z,33

Cuenta que no quiere pero me tiene espionaje (eh-eh)

He say he wanna touch it, and tease it, and squeeze it
While my piggy bank is hungry, my nigga, you need to feed it
If the text ain't freaky, I don't wanna read it
And just to let you know this punani is undefeated, ay
He say he really want to see me more
I said we should have a date, where? At the Lamborghini store
I'm kinda scary, hard to read, I'm like a ouija board
But I'ma boss, bitch, who you gonna leave me for?
You hoes got no class, you bitches is broke still
I'll be talkin' cash while I'm poppin' my gold grill (uh)
I'm a hoe, rich bitch and I work like I'm broke still (Cardi)
But they love be so fake, but they hate be so real (uh)
El booty sobresale de mi traje
No traje pantiesito pa' que el nene no trabaje
Es que yo me sé lo que tú cree que tú no sabe
Dice que no quiere pero se quiere comer el equipaje
Báilame como si fuera la última vez

Careful when you come through my way
My body already know how to play
Work it, keep it tight every day
And I, I, I know you need a taste
When I ooh, you're fallin' in love
Give a little ooh-ooh, get it well done
Dancing on my ooh, make your girl wanna run
We keep moving 'til the sun come up
Porque I am the party, yo soy fiesta
Blow out your candles, have a siesta
You can try pero no one can stop me
What my taki taki wants, yeah, my taki taki gets, uh
Báilame como si fuera la última vez
Y enséñame ese pasito que no sé
Un besito bien suavecito, bebé

"[Intro]
Party Rock
Yeah
Woo!

[Chorus: Redfoo]
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time (Yeah)
And we gon' make you lose your mind (Woo!)
Everybody just have a good time (Clap!)
Party rock is in the house tonight (Oh!)
Everybody just have a good time (I can feel it, baby!)
And we gon' make you lose your mind (Yeah)
We just wanna see you...

[Verse 1: SkyBlu]
In the club: Party rock
Looking for your girl? She on my jock (Huh)
Non-stop when we in the spot
Booty moving weight like she on the block (Woo!)
Where the drank? I gots to know
Tight jeans, tattoo, 'cause I'm rock and roll
Half-black, half-white: domino
Gainin' money, Oprah, dough
Yo! I'm running through these hoes like Drano
I got that devilish flow rock and roll no halo, we party rock!
Yeah, that’s the crew that I'm reppin'
On the rise to the top, no Led in our Zeppelin (Hey!)

[Chorus: Redfoo]
Party rock is in the house tonight (Woo!)
Everybody just have a good time (Yeah)
And we gon' make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time (Let's go!)
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time (I can feel it, baby!)
And we gon' make you lose your mind
We just wanna see you...
Shake that!

Every day I'm shufflin' (Shake)
Shufflin', shufflin' (Shake)

[Verse 2: Redfoo]
Step up fast and be the first girl to make me throw this cash
We get money, don't be mad, now stop - hatin' is bad
One more shot for us (Another round!)
Please fill up my cup (Don't mess around!)
We just wanna see (You shake it now!)
Now you wanna be (You're naked now!)

[Bridge: Lauren Bennett & Redfoo]
Get up, get down, put your hands up to the sound
Get up, get down, put your hands up to the sound
Get up, get down, put your hands up to the sound (Woo!)
Put your hands up to the sound
Put your hands up to the sound (Let's go!)
Get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up
Put your hands up to the sound
To the sound
Put your hands up (Woo!)
Put your hands up
Put your hands up

"For English people that don’t know what does this says 

This song is about she, she says she prefers old guys instead of young people as she to hang out with and well in the video u can see she just want them by their money 
The lyrics says 
“I like that they treat me like a lady, even though sometimes I forgot when we are on the bed 
I like that they tell me poetry in the ear at night when we’re doing other things.
I like interesting gentleman that can be a good friend and at the same time a good lover, It doesn’t care a few more years,
I like them older, those called sirs, the kind that open you the car door and send you flowers
I like them bigger that doesn’t fit me in the mouth 
The kisses he wants to gives me, that he drives me crazy” 
Ik in spanish this song has double sense u know why. That’s the first part when she sings, it may not be perfectly translated cuz I did my own even thought it’s honest work 😂

"ALREADY THIS SONG HAS LYRICS BUT I WANT İT...I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list
But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

"For anyone who wants to know the storyline between the videos listen here!

So the whole thing starts with The Hills in which The Weeknd gets in a car crash and then he emerges as well as a girl with him. The car in this video is actually a representation of his old self (Trilogy Weeknd) and when he emerges from the now destroyed car it is his new mainstream self (the freeform dreads represent this and he is very aware of the mainstream route hes taking btw), the girl is the fans always nagging at him to go back to who he used to be and keep nagging at him until the car explodes representing theres no more ""old"" Weeknd anymore this is who he is now. So he keeps walking until he walks into a mansion where in the top room there is genderless person (I really dont what gender it is), with a bunch of sexualized girls around it (also note the room is tinted red like hell), this person represents the devil.

The story line continues in I Cant Feel My Face where Mr. XO is performing on a stage at a classy bar it seems. This video doesnt really have much until we see the devil (the genderless person) looking deeply at the Weeknd. This implys that the devil is the music industry making him perform, as when he sees this person his dancing intensifies until the devil catches him on fire. This shows he will perform through anything just to get the person (devil/music industry) to like him, this makes sense considering his last album was great but definetly more mainstream than previously before.

Then we go to Tell Your Friends where at the very beginning the new mainstream Weeknd is burying the old one, but you can see the old Weeknd struggling in the plastic bag while being buried implying hes getting buried alive. After burying him the mainstream Weeknd walks forward and keeps doing so until he sees the devil. In which then he shoots it killing it. He has now killed what controls him and gets in the car and drives off looking to see what the future holds him. However he sees that hes still not as happy as he was before The Hills so...

We have Starboy where the mainstream dreaded Weeknd is sitting in his beautiful home until his old self comes up behind him and strangles the mainstream Weeknd with the own plastic bag he buried him alive with. Then we see the old Weeknd who has the short Trilogy flattop again. We see him with a cross symbolizing either The Weeknd has found Christ, or more simply is using the cross as a representation of resurrection. He then goes around his house destroying all the memorabilia that represented the mainstream Weeknd. However after this he goes in a car with a cat which shortly after turns into a panther this could be him saying hes going back to his bigger and better self but I dont really know. So in the end in all this I think this Starboy video shows us hes back to making he likes as well as what we like. 

PLEASE LIKE THIS COMMENT I SPENT SO MUCH TIME DECYPHERING ALL THE VIDEOS CONNECTED!!!

He also says in Tell Your Friends, ""We are not the same I am too reckless, I dont wanna go in that direction."" And all of this is being said while his old self is being buried, (his old self still has the dreads because at this time he didnt want to cut them off until for Starboy.)

Wow, its obvious in the new album that he's embracing this pop sound. He will eventually see the downsides and go back. 

Edit: I just watched M A N I A and there is more to be said about the panther im just trying to process it. If I do decypher that video it will be on M A N I A.",2016-11-25T21:23:50Z,6063

"Lyrics : 

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning,
No kidding,
I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind

I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy,
Don't know what hit me,

But I'll be alright
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you

You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, ohoh
How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too

The world is beating you down,
I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse

My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing,
It's ringing, in my head for you
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections

Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning

Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, ohoh
Give me all of you
Cards on the table,
We're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges

All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you
I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, ohoh",2020-09-07T15:19:51Z,8

"Once Albert Einstein was sitting right next an indian man on a flight, Einstein told him that he is a great scientists from Germany. Einstein make a bet with him that ""I will ask you a question and if you are not able to answer it then you will give me 5$,
then you ask me question and if am not able to answer then i will give u 500$.

The man thinks 5$ : 500$ seems like a good ratio so he says sure.

Einstein asks what is the distance between Earth and the moon?
The man hands over 5$ to him and replied I don't know.

Now its the Indian man turn to ask Einstein a question. He asks ""which animal goes up a mountion with 3 legs and comes down with 4?""

Einstein thinks and thinks 🤔and finally hands over 500$ to the man.
The man took 500$ and went to sleep.

Einstein is so much annoyed😠, he woke up the man and said hey I had given you 500$ and just tell me
which animal goes up a mountion with 3 legs and comes down with 4?

"Lyrics 🇧🇷 


What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
Give me all of you, oh
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you
I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh",2020-09-07T23:39:42Z,2

"[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, hey
I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's hatnin'?
You and your ass invited
So gon' and get to clappin'
So pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in Miami (-ami)
Wake up with no jammies (Nope)
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio serve that scampi (Julio!)
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now

[Pre-Chorus]
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

[Chorus]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Verse 2]
I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico
Say the word and we go (Say it)
You can be my freaka (Brrrt!)
Girl, I'll be a fleeko
Mamacita
I will never make a promise that I can't keep
I promise that your smile ain't gon' never leave
Shopping sprees in Paris
Everything 24 karats
Take a look in that mirror
Now tell me who's the fairest
Is it you? (Is it you?) Is it me? (Is it me?)
Say it's us (Say it's us) and I'll agree, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Bridge]
If you say you want a good time
Well here I am baby, here I am baby
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind (What's on your mind)
If you want it, girl come and get it
All this is here for you
Tell me baby, tell me, tell me baby
What you tryna do


[Chorus]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow
we could've had it all
We could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
It all, it all, it all, (you're gonna wish you never had met me)

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there 'cause mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling

And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

Fresh out East Atlanta
Bump on her bumper like a traffic jam (jam)
Hey, I was quick to pay that girl like Uncle Sam (here you go, ay)
Back it on me, shawty cravin' on me
Get to eatin' on me (on me)
She waited on me (then what?)
Shawty cakin' on me, got the bacon on me (wait up)
This is history in the makin' on me (on me)
Point blank, close range, that B
If it cost a million, that's me (that's me)
I was gettin' mula, pretty baby

[Camila Cabello:]
Havana, ooh na-na (ay, ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (oh, ay, ay)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (oh no)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana
My heart is in Havana
Havana, ooh na-na

He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana
My heart is in Havana (ay)

"This Girl deserves the world...Romance should have gone bigger. Camilizers' lets do something!!!
I suggest we pick one of her songs at a time, set a realistic  target for it to cross. Listen to it and once we have completed the target and are satisfied, we move on to the next song.


I say we start with *First Man* the video she released on fathers day...it's on 1.9M views right now on youtube...let's make it cross 50M! I know it's difficult but us Camilizers can do anything!!
Let's give her all the love we can!! Camilizers rockkk!!!!

"Cuando no la llamo
Siempre me hace reclamos
Discutimos, peleamos
Pero llego a casa en la noche
La molesto y arreglamos

Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Peleamos, nos arreglamos
Nos mantenemos en esa pero nos amamos
Ay vamos
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Qué pena me daría
No tenerte en mi vida, vida mía, mami
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Peleamos, nos arreglamos
Nos mantenemos en esa pero nos amamos
Ay vamos

Qué pena me daría
No tenerte en mi vida, vida mía (ay vamos)

No importa si estás lejos
Siempre te siento presente
Y estoy pendiente de ti frecuentemente
Cuando estoy en la calle
Resolviendo mis problemas
Es pa' nuestro futuro
Yo no sé por qué me celas
No soy un santo
Tampoco ando en cosas malas
Cuando no estoy contigo
Es porque ando con mis panas
Somos polos opuestos
Y por eso nos gustamos
Qué más le vamos a hacer
Si así nos enamoramos
Y ahí vamos

Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Peleamos, nos arreglamos
Nos mantenemos en esa pero nos amamos
Ay vamos
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Qué pena me daría
No tenerte en mi vida, vida mía, mami

Todos los días yo la tengo que ver
Así peleemos primero, mi mujer
Mami, no me celes tanto
Que yo siempre me conmuevo con tu llanto
Nena, nena, tranquilícese
Que en la calle a nadie besé
Yo solo tengo ojos pa' usted
Relájate, despreocúpate
Nena, nena, tranquilícese
Que en la calle a nadie besé
Yo solo tengo ojos pa' usted
Relájate, despreocúpate
Que ahí vamos

Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Peleamos, nos arreglamos
Nos mantenemos en esa pero nos amamos

Yeah

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rollin' up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touchin' road?
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

"English lyrics:
I like my reggae
Tiritiritiririti-daddy
Evo Jedis
When i saw her
I said: ""if that woman were for me""
Forgive me, I had to tell you
'You are tough, tough
Hard, hard, hard
How tough, hand up because you look good
'You are tough mamacita, you left level
Hard, look how your skin shines
'You're tough, tell me, tell me, how is it?
'You're tough, I'll give you a twenty out of ten'
'You're tough, tough, tough
You are the machine, the dance machine
If you don't have anyone, come to my arms
That perfume is felt in the air
Something like Argentina, you bring me the Buenos Aires
'So powerful, mean scandalous
There will be many women but you are something else
If it were a crime that you are beautiful
I arrest you in my bed and I put the wife on you '
You got the touch, touch, touch
Look at the material, special edition
You got the touch, touch, touch
Forgive me, I had to tell you
'You are tough, tough
Hard, hard, hard
How tough, hand up because you look good
'You are tough mamacita, you left level
Hard, look how your skin shines
'You're tough, tell me, tell me, how is it?
'You're tough, I'll give you a twenty out of ten'
'You're tough, tough, tough
I like the way that ram pam pam moves
My mind scheming on a plan plan plan
If he leaves me, in that curve I give him pam pam
What is your recipe I do not know, 'tá pa' eat well
I like the way that ram pam pam moves
My mind scheming on a plan plan plan
If he leaves me, in that curve I give him pam pam

Give me the number to enter with you in detail
And you got the touch, touch, touch
You look like a star making the fuss
You got the touch, touch, touch
The internet goes down when you upload a photo
When I saw her (tell me, baby girl)
I said: ""if that woman were for me"" (for me that baby)
Forgive me, I had to tell you
'You're tough (oh), tough (hey)
Hard, hard, hard
How tough, hand up because you look good
'You are tough mamacita, you left level
Hard, look how your skin shines (come on)
'You're tough, tell me, tell me, how is it? (hey)
'You're tough, I'll give you a twenty out of ten'

Colours and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt
Suddenly goes away somehow

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

One step closer
One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Es un placer conocerla
Que bien te ves
Te adelanto, no me importa quién sea él

Una aventura es más divertida
Si huele a peligro
Si te invito a una copa
Y me acerco a tu boca
Si te robo un besito
A ver, ¿te enojas conmigo?
¿Qué dirías si esta noche
Te seduzco en mi coche?
Que se empañen los vidrios
Y la regla es que goces
Si te falto el respeto
Y luego culpo al alcohol
Si levanto tu falda
¿Me darías el derecho
A medir tu sensatez?
Poner en juego tu cuerpo
Si te parece prudente

Permíteme apreciar tu desnudez

"Уверовавший

First things first

Во-первых,

I'mma say all the words inside my head

Я скажу всё, что думаю,

I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh woo

Во мне бушует пламя, я устал от того, как всё было раньше, о-оо,

The way that things have been, oh woo

Как всё было раньше, оо.

Second thing second

Во-вторых,

Don't you tell me what you think that I could be

Не говори мне, каким я, по-твоему, мог бы стать,

I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh

Я в одиночном плавании, я повелитель своего моря, о-оо,

The master of my sea, oh ooh

Повелитель своего моря, о-оо.



I was broken from a young age

С малого возраста я был сломлен,

Taking my sulk into the masses

Вечно не в духе на людях,

Writing my poems for the few

Писал стихи для тех немногих,

That look to me

Кто считался со мной,

Took to me, shook me, feeling me

Обращался ко мне, потрясал меня, чувствовал меня.

Singing from heartache from the pain

Я пою с сердечной болью полученных травм,

Taking my message from the veins

По венам течет то послание, которое я хочу донести,

Speaking my lesson from the brain

Делюсь выученным уроком,

Seeing the beauty through the...

Вижу красоту через...



Pain!

Боль!

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Ты заставила меня, заставила меня верить, верить.

Pain!

Боль!

You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer

Ты сломала меня и собрала заново, я научился верить, верить.

Pain!

Боль!

Let the bullets fly, oh let them rain

Пусть летят пули, пусть обрушиваются дождем,

My life, my love, my drive, it came from...

Моя жизнь, моя любовь, мой драйв — все пришло ко мне от...

Pain!

Боли!

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Ты заставила меня, заставила меня верить, верить.



Third things third

В-третьих,

Send a prayer to the ones up above

Молись за тех, кто на небесах,

All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh

Вся услышанная тобой ненависть научила твою душу летать, словно голубь,

Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

Твою душу на небесах, о-оо.



I was choking in the crowd

В толпе я задыхался,

Building my rain up in the cloud

Собираясь пролиться дождём из облаков,

Falling like ashes to the ground

Падая на землю, словно пепел,

Hoping my feelings, they would drown

Надеясь, что мои чувства захлебнутся.

But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing

Но этого так и не случилось, они выжили среди приливов и отливов,

Inhibited, limited

Подавляемые, сдерживаемые,

Till it broke open and it rained down

Пока небеса не разверзлись и не пролились дождём.

You rained down, like...

Ты пролился дождём, словно...



Pain!

Боль!

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Ты заставила меня, заставила меня верить, верить.

Pain!

Боль!

You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer

Ты сломала меня и собрала заново, я научился верить, верить.

Pain!

Боль!

Let the bullets fly, oh let them rain

Пусть летят пули, пусть обрушиваются дождем,

My life, my love, my drive, it came from...

Моя жизнь, моя любовь, мой драйв — все пришло ко мне от...

Pain!

Боли!

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Ты заставила меня, заставила меня верить, верить.



Last things last

И наконец,

By the grace of the fire and the flame

По милости огня и пламени,

You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh

Ты лик моего будущего, кровь в моих венах, о-оо,

The blood in my veins, oh ooh

Кровь в моих венах, о-оо.

But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing

Но этого так и не случилось, они выжили среди приливов и отливов,

Inhibited, limited

Подавляемые, сдерживаемые,

Till it broke open and it rained down

Пока небеса не разверзлись и не пролились дождём.

You rained down, like...

Ты пролился дождём, словно...



Pain!

Ты заставила меня, заставила меня верить, верить.

My life, my love, my drive, it came from...

= No love from loved ones
= Going to bed at late nights
= Introverts

"Once Albert Einstein was sitting right next an indian man on a flight, Einstein told him that he is a great scientists from Germany. Einstein make a bet with him that ""I will ask you a question and if you are not able to answer it then you will give me 5$,
then you ask me question and if am not able to answer then i will give u 500$.

The man thinks 5$ : 500$ seems like a good ratio so he says sure.

Einstein asks what is the distance between Earth and the moon?
The man hands over 5$ to him and replied I don't know.

Now its the Indian man turn to ask Einstein a question. He asks ""which animal goes up a mountion with 3 legs and comes down with 4?""

Einstein thinks and thinks 🤔and finally hands over 500$ to the man.
The man took 500$ and went to sleep.

Einstein is so much annoyed😠, he woke up the man and said hey I had given you 500$ and just tell me
which animal goes up a mountion with 3 legs and comes down with 4?

The Indian man gives Einstein another 5$ and replied I don't know

"Let me introduce you to my party people
In the club

It's a new generation of party people
Get 'em up, yeah

If you go hard, you gotta get on the floor
If you're a party freak then step on the floor
If you're an animal then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor
Yeah we work on the floor

Don't stop, keep it moving
Put your drinks up!
Pick your body up and drop it on the floor
Let the rhythm change your world on the floor
You know we're running shit tonight on the floor

Brazil, Morocco
London to Ibiza
Straight to L.A., New York
Vegas to Africa

Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more

La la la la la, la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
La la la la la, la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor

I know you got it, clap your hands on the floor
And keep on rockin', rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor
On the floor

Don't stop, keep it moving
Put your drinks up!
It's getting ill, it's getting sick on the floor
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I ain't wrong, we'll probably die on the floor

Tonight we gon' be it on the floor

Break it off, kick it out

"¡CNCOwners!!!  ¡Es muy importante!

(ESTO ES PARA EL STR3AM DE *BESO* )

Detenganse un momento por favor, Lean atentamente y hagan sus cuentas.


SOMOS 10M (supuestamente) pero digamos que solo nos esforzamos 1M... hagamos el str3@m correcto y veremos como las v!st@s suben. Si hicieramos el str3@m correcto solo con ver el MV unas 20 veces, basta y sobra. Pero ese no es el caso.

Si hiciéramos las cosas como se deben, deberiamos pasar a los 5M en las 24 Horas.

YOUTUBE no nos está robando v!st@s. ¿Saben quién si? CNCOwner mism@. 

Primero que nada dejen de comentar 3m0j!s


Segundo: Disfruten el MV, véanlo completo desde cero hasta que termina, no se salten anuncios, DISFRUTEN DEL MV, eso es lo más importante, YouTube no es pendejo y no va a dejar que solo por ver el MV unos segundos sea tomado como V!st@. Por favor reflexión, CNCO trabaja muy duro con sus canciones para solo por v!st@s meternos unos segundos y no disfrutar nada. Las cosas van a mejorar si hacemos las cosas correctamente y valoramos su trabajo, el trabajo de CNCO.

Tercero: Pasen de cinco a diez MVs más de CNCO (Igualmente vean los vídeos completos sin saltarse los anuncios, es importante que pasen mas de 30 min antes de volver Este MV) , les doy como consejo las que están por llegar al billón o las nuevas como Honey boo. Y RL, no se olviden de reggaetón lento.

Seamos unidas, y sobre todo disfrutemos del MV, verán que si hacemos esto las vistas subirán.

 YouTube las va a contar y CNCO sentirá satisfacción al saber que CNCOwner disfruta del hermoso video que ellos se esforzaron por hacer y la canción. 


Por favor compartan la información, ayuden a que más CNCOwners lo vean. No hagan caso a provocaciones y sigamos disfrutando del MV.


IMPORTANTE TAMBIÉN. NO VEAN LOS VIDEOS LIRYCS ni REACCIONES, AL MENOS NO DURANTE LAS PRIMERAS 24 HORAS. TENEMOS QUE LLEGAR A LOS 5M  ¡¡¡si o si!!!

The content of this MV is actually about a girl gang (led by Daya) who blocked the way of The Chainsmokers' car to collect car tolls. The Chainsmokers refused to do so & the gang didn't move a muscle so they had no choice but to crash them with their car. But the gang's magical power of making cars jumping up and down by dancing had made them hovering in the air for the entire night. The name of the song is actually their calling for help.",2020-09-06T10:43:29Z,4

"hey you! The person behind the screen reading this! I just want you to know your a beautiful, nice person. If some one says your not good, who even are they? You have the chance to make your story SHINE. So do it! Here is something to do time-to-time.

Go hang out with a old friend.(on zoom or something obviously)
Go do what you like.
Eat a food that you enjoy.

All of those little things can make you better and happier as a person!

I know I’m just a stranger but you might be going through a though time, and I am not trying to get a lot of likes but I want people to see this and feel better 
about them self.
And yes your a stranger but beautiful in someone’s eyes! 


Now at days we determine are-self by society, and how great someone is determined by their looks, not actions So I would like to make a change by making society different.



Sorry for any grammar issues in this!
And for the creator of this video, this is a master piece! It brightened my day!
Credit to my therapist that told me some of these things lmao. My final message: YOU. ARE. WORTH. IT!!!

Desde acá qué rico se ve

"Esto vamo' a arrancarlo con altura
El dembow lo canto con hondura
Dicen una estrella, una figura
De Héctor aprendí la sabrosura
Nunca viste una joya tan pura

Aquí en la altura están fuertes los vientos
Ponte el cinturón y coge asiento
A tu jeva ya la vi por dentro (yes)
El dinero nunca pierde tiempo (no, no)
Contra la pared (tú lo sabe')

Desde acá qué rico se ve
No soy Sky pero rompí el bajo otra vez

I like that Justin puts girls with short hair or almost bald hair in his videos too. Cause it always is seen as not feminine or ugly.. I really hate that cause I've been bald and now I have short hair and I can't do anything about it. And I don't find it that ugly or not feminine. That Justin puts these girls in his videos also shows to other people that you can still look feminine or pretty with short hair or being bald.,2015-11-14T16:13:20Z,2415

Shine bright like a diamond

Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky

You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

"Lyrics:
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me, "" I beg
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me, "" I begged
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
""Don't forget me, "" I beg
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
Never mind, I'll find someone like you

Don’t end it until you fully use a pencil. Don’t end it because you could still smile a few more times.

That you found a girlyour married now.

Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.
Sanırım sana vermediğimi o vermiştir.
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Eski arkadaş, neden bu kadar çekingensin?
It ain't you to hold back or hide from the lie.

Yüzümü görünce sana hatırlatmasını umuyordum,

Nevermind, I'll find someone you.
Mühim değil,senin gibi birini bulurum.
I wish nothing but the best for you too.

"letra

Seu homem está na estrada, promovendo

Você disse 'mantenha nosso relacionamento em segredo'

Eu só estou tentando te tirar da friendzone

Pois você é muito mais linda que nas fotos

Não consigo achar sua casa, me mande o endereço

Dirigindo pelo portão fechado

Descobriu que eu estava vindo

Mandou suas amigas para casa

Continua tentando esconder, mas suas amigas sabem



Eu só te ligo quando são cinco e meia

A única hora que eu estarei ao seu lado

Eu só te amo quando você me toca, não me sente

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse é o verdadeiro eu

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse é o verdadeiro eu, é

Eu só transo com você quando são cinco e meia

A única hora em que eu vou te chamar de minha

Eu só gosto quando você me toca, não me sente

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse é o verdadeiro eu

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse é o verdadeiro eu



Eu vou te falar e deixar isso bem claro

Tentar continuar com isso não parece tão simples

Pois eu acabei de transar com duas vadias antes de te ver

Você tem que fazer isso no meu tempo

Sempre tentando me mandar para a reabilitação

Essas drogas me fazem sentir descafeinado

Eu só quero curtir o momento

E esses filhos da mãe querem uma recaída



Eu só te ligo quando são cinco e meia

A única hora que eu estarei ao seu lado

Eu só te amo quando você me toca, não me sente

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse é o verdadeiro eu

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse é o verdadeiro eu, é

Eu só transo com você quando são cinco e meia

A única hora em que eu vou te chamar de minha

Eu só gosto quando você me toca, não me sente

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse é o verdadeiro eu

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse é o verdadeiro eu



Colinas têm olhos, essas colinas têm olhos

Quem é você para julgar, quem é você para julgar?

Esconda suas mentiras, garota, esconda suas mentiras

Só confie em você, só em você



Eu só te ligo quando são cinco e meia

A única hora que eu estarei ao seu lado

Eu só te amo quando você me toca, não me sente

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse é o verdadeiro eu

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse é o verdadeiro eu, é

Eu só transo com você quando são cinco e meia

"[Verse 1]
Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, ""Keep our business on the low-low""
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
[Verse 2]
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Bridge]
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge? Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies (Hide your lies, oh, baby)
Only you to trust, only you
[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

"I finally understand the video's meaning.
Towards the beginning, he was high on cocaine and decided to go on a ride to get some more, however, on his way there he f*cked up while driving the car and ended up crashing and flipping over the vehicle. Then the music video starts and The Weeknd begins to sing. Him walking slowly to the house is a symbol of him entering the gates of hell or the clouds of heaven. As he goes in the house, he realizes all the sins he committed during his lifetime, and knew he couldn't go into heaven because he had traded his soul for the money and fame. That is why he changed what door he was walking into. At the end, he finally met his destination, which is the Devil's Den, who is waiting for him. The Ladies are a symbol of the sacrifice he made for Life Fortune. The man waiting for him is the devil in a human form. After the video goes black, this means The Devil claimed his soul, which is why the video turned black.",2015-06-04T11:23:40Z,2617

"Once Albert Einstein was sitting right next an indian man on a flight, Einstein told him that he is a great scientists from Germany. Einstein make a bet with him that ""I will ask you a question and if you are not able to answer it then you will give me 5$,
then you ask me question and if am not able to answer then i will give u 500$.

The man thinks 5$ : 500$ seems like a good ratio so he says sure.

Einstein asks what is the distance between Earth and the moon?
The man hands over 5$ to him and replied I don't know.

Now its the Indian man turn to ask Einstein a question. He asks ""which animal goes up a mountion with 3 legs and comes down with 4?""

Einstein thinks and thinks 🤔and finally hands over 500$ to the man.
The man took 500$ and went to sleep.

Einstein is so much annoyed😠, he woke up the man and said hey I had given you 500$ and just tell me
which animal goes up a mountion with 3 legs and comes down with 4?

The Indian man gives Einstein another 5$ and replied I don't know

The girl Answered with a loud angry voice; ""I don't want to spend the night with you!!
 All the people in the library started staring at the boy and he was embarrassed. 
After minutes the girl walked quietly to the guy's table and said to him I study psychology and I know what man is thinking, I guess you felt embarrassed,right? 
The guy responded with a loud voice :$300 for one night That's too much!! and all the people in the library looked at the girl in shock and the guy whispered in her ears,

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

Welcome to the room of people who have rooms of people
That they loved one day stocked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You're lovin' on the psychopath sitting next to you
You're lovin' on the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, ""How'd I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
Yeah, trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions
You're lovin' on the freakshow sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think, ""How did I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget
(Watch it)
(Watch it)

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
(Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
(Watch it)
Please all my friends are heathens, take it slow
(Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know

Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed
I tried to warn you just to stay away
And now they're outside ready to bust
It looks like you might be one of us",2020-09-06T18:05:36Z,49

Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And its so its so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me
Do I look okay, I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Because you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Because girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she let me
Her laugh her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday
Oh you know you know you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what your searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look ok
You know I'll say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Because girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Because girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
The way you are
The way you are
Girl your amazing
Just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change

"The lazy song - do not having a goal in life
I wanna be a billionaire - finally making a goal
24K magic - achieving that goal and being rich
Uptown Funk - being too hot for girls
Just the way you are - finding a girlfriend
That's what I like - treating girlfriend
Locked out of heaven - having some fun with girlfriend
It will rain - realizing that you are bad boyfriend despite to your richness and you about to break up with her
Grenade - breaking up
When I was your man - accepting the fact that you broke up with her.",2020-08-29T13:52:22Z,72

"Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me ""Do I look okay?""
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah
Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday
Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

Just the way you are

"Me delata la mirada
Hacerme el tonto para qué
Si a mi no me importa nada
Prefiero vivir y perder
Que no haber vivido nada
Si te vas
Quedaré en un dolor
Que jamás conocí

Como arena en el viento
Sin brújula sin direcciones
Pisado y sediento
Lo mismo que ver un humano
Sin alma en el cuerpo
Si te vas
Quedaré en un dolor
Que jamás conocí

Andas en mi cabeza
Nena a todas horas
(No sé cómo explicarte)
El mundo me da vuelta
Tú me descontrolas
(No paro de pensarte)
Porque me la paso imaginando que
(Imaginando que)
Contigo me casé
Y por siempre te amé (I love you, girl)

Andas en mi cabeza
Nena a todas horas
(Cada segundo, cada minuto)
El mundo me da vuelta
Tú me descontrolas
(Cada segundo, cada minuto)
Por ti me la paso imaginando que
(Imaginando que)
Contigo me casé
Y por siempre te amé

Imagínate que tú conoces lo que desconoces
Yo me convierto en lobo después de las doce
Si no tuviera mi loba para que la despose
Me voy con la manada hasta que me destroce
Por que en la calle hay mucha compet eh eh!
Siempre lo bueno se corrompe eh eh!
Pero me viene otra mujer aprovechándose
Cuando tu eres la que me encanta, chica!

Nunca yo me atrevería a dejarte, sola
Chiqui, chiqui, chiqui, chiquitica nunca, sola
Por ti yo guarde mi pistola
Las gatitas no me controlan
Estas dudando yo lo se
Pero me quieres a la vez
Solo pide que, te de my love
Que te de my love, que te de

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas
(No sé como explicarte)
El mundo me da vueltas, tu me descontrolas
(No paro de pensarte)
Por ti me la paso imaginándo que
(Imaginando que)
Contigo me casé
Y por siempre te amé (I love you, girl)

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas
(Cada segundo, cada minuto)
El mundo me da vueltas, tu me descontrolas
(Cada segundo, cada minuto)
Por ti me la paso imaginándo que
(Imaginando que)
Contigo me casé
Y por siempre te amé

Si tu te vas, se muere el amor
El que tu me das y llega el dolor
Seré un vagabundo solo en este mundo
Sin rumbo, sin rumbo
Si tu te vas (te vas), se muere el amor (amor)
El que tu me das (me das) y llega el dolor (y llega el dolor)
Seré un vagabundo solo en este mundo
Sin rumbo, sin rumbo

Tu eres mi musa, eres mi letra, tu eres mi armonía
Eres el agua que me ahoga en la melancolía
Chino y nacho y Daddy Yankee, te trajeron esta melodía
Convertida en poesía bebe, para que goces y vaciles tu ve
Romántico pero le metemos brutal!

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas
El mundo me da vueltas, tu me descontrolas
Por ti me la paso imaginando que
Contigo me casé
Y que por siempre te amé

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas
(Cada segundo, cada minuto)
El mundo me da vueltas, tu me descontrolas
(Cada segundo, cada minuto)
Por ti me la paso imaginándo que
(Imaginando que)
Contigo me casé
Y por siempre te amé",2020-08-13T01:50:41Z,46

Pasa que volví a mi pueblo el 2016, fui a un bingo de la iglesia e iba escuchando esta música en la trayectoria del camino cuando justo vi que ella estaba ahí, pero en ese entonces yo ya tenía novia. Pero igual sentía amor por esa chica. Hasta 2017 que me llene de valentía y comente una foto suya, y ahí fue donde comenzó todo.

Dando un gran ejemplo, donde NO estan insitando al sexo, al alcohol y a las drogas, ni denigrando a las mujeres y mostrandolas con poca ropa, donde aquí salen todo tipo de personas no sólo ""modelos"" y mostrándonos otro tipo de contenido muyy diferente a lo que la mayoría de los rregaetoneros nos muestran cada día.  Nos estan demostrando que hay muchas formas de tener éxito, sin tener que caer en lo que mayoría hace. Van creciendo como la espuma, cada vez se superan más..

"I don’t think people actually realize the impact of lyrics. So, I’m just going to explain it (on how I see it) to satisfy my need of making sense of it. P.S. I will make a summary at the bottom if you don’t want to read it all. Or maybe your not going to read it at all. Whatever floats your boat, or I guess fix your dishwasher. One more thing, I’m not doing this for likes, I’m only doing this for my enjoyment and satisfaction that I got my thoughts across. 

Verse 1:

Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

In the first verse, he reminisces about the times he had with her, particularly one time when she said she was so happy she could die. The line after that, he was hoping that she was there for him, but it still made him feel lonely. He thinks it’s love, and it still pains him to think about it. He was always lonely with her.

Verse 2:


You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

This one I can actually relate to and is probably the main reason why I chose to write this entire explanation. It’s true you can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness, or you can get sad from it. Nostalgia, remembering the good times, with his fiancé. I get lost in it, especially in these depressing and dark times, but we should remember the past, not get stuck in it. He gets a bit more nostalgic remembering the good times. In the first verse, he says now and then except now he gets a bit sad. I think this is his recovery, and when she integrated into his life, left a hole where she came in, he started missing her more. After they broke up, he thinks he can do fine without her, he then later starts missing her even more.

Wow, one paragraph about 1 line, I’ll make this quick(er).
The next is like resignation to the end, which mirrors what I said about nostalgia. If you were going to die, you think back to your happiest moments (I hope). Always the end, it’s always the end that has you wishing to go back. You never miss it until you lose it is kind of the message. Next line is simple; he realizes (presumably after a fight) how they couldn’t seek common ground, that they shouldn’t be together. A toxic relationship which is an all to real thing. She said that they could be friends, but after they realized that couldn’t work out, she started avoiding him. If you’ve been dating for a while, then it’s harder to get out of a relationship. It’s hard to let go because you’re hoping it will work out. Then he says that I’m glad that we stopped pretending we could even be friends.

Verse 3:

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you’re just somebody that I used to know 3x

So after he admits their relationship is toxic, and she cuts him off, he says that she can’t completely just ignore him. She can’t just pretend like nothing ever happened, and he found acceptance. She did not accept the relationship they had and basically erase her identity. Start out fresh, which is a good idea in theory but in practice is just so wrong. She treats him like a stranger and ignores everything. He keeps bugging her (not a good idea, you need space so both of you can recover) and she changes her phone number and any records that she was there. He then accepts that as well, realizing he doesn’t need her at all anymore. Finally, all that’s left of her is his memory of her, and what she represents. A hopeful life, a happy family and something for each other to lean on.

Verse 4:

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

This time, it switches POV to her. This was a change to show her reasoning. Now that she’s out of this toxic relationship, she recalls “all the times you screwed me over”. He was the real toxicity of this relationship. He was abusive, and manipulated her. He always blamed her for something that he did as ‘leverage’. She figures out all of her troubles, struggles that she endured with him, we’re all his fault. That’s why she stooped so low, she never wanted to meet someone else. Sometimes people don’t even realize they’re toxic, it just depends on what they do. Don’t blame yourself until you actually see it without rose-tinted glasses. He wants the relationship back, but when they broke up he said he wouldn’t care about her.  She finds independence, freedom and acceptance. She finds him thinking about her and she tells him the time when they broke up. She realizes the relationship was toxic, and he gets adamant. Refuses, and when she finally wins the argument, he storms off yelling that he won’t care what would happen to her. I guess he realizes it too late, when the relationship was over.

Verse 5:

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody (I used to know)
(Somebody) Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody (I used to know)
(Somebody) Now you're just somebody that I used to know
I used to know, that I used to know, I used to know somebody

This time, he wants repentance, he wants to show her he’s changed. But, from the context of the song, their relationship must have been going on for a while. I think that’s the number one reason why she didn’t break up sooner. She felt if they just let it die down, he would change or  she would change. Again, taking blame for something she didn’t do. The reason why this verse was repeated (and not just because it’s a song) was to send home the fact that she truly doesn’t care for him. The song flips the story over because at the start, he was the one who said he wouldn’t care.

Summary:This took me an hour to write, so I’m looking for LIKES! I’m just kidding, like if you want but please don’t feel forced to. This summary is how I see this songs lyrics, ok, so don’t go around complaining about how this or that, how he intended that it was made as a way to distract everyone so the U.S. government could sneak up on us while we were distracted. This song is (remember this is how I see it) about acceptance.

He recalls his relationship with her, hoping that she could be the missing piece in his puzzle and vice versa. He starts trying to remember more of her, of what she was like, getting addicted to a “certain kind of sadness”.  Nostalgia, or the sadness of how we can’t go back to it. She wanted to be friends, but it didn’t work out and he was glad they could move on from their relationship. She cuts him off, hoping to get away from him, treating him like a stranger. She is basically gone, replaced only by his memory, just somebody that he used to know. It switches to her POV, she realizing that her relationship was toxic. He was manipulative and controlling, and she didn’t realize until they broke up. She recalls all the times he was controlling and found him stuck thinking on her, maybe looking at photos of them together. She walks up to him and tells him what happened when they broke up. He said he wouldn’t care about her and she thought she would. In the end, the story flips it all and the person who finds acceptance is her.

Kudos to Rafaellarsa *Come on, take a bow* for helping me with the POV switch.

Ahora puedo regalar, un pedacito a cada nena
Sólo un pedacito

Tú me partiste el corazón (Ay mi corazón)
Pero mi amor no hay problema, no, no
Ahora puedo regalar (ya que, ya que), un pedacito a cada nena
Sólo un pedacito

[Verso 1: Maluma]
Ya no vengas más con esos cuentos mami
Si desde el principio siempre estuve pa' ti
Nunca me avisaron cuál era el problema
Te gusta estar rodando por camas ajena
Ahora me tocó a mí cambiar el sistema
Andar con gatas nuevas, repartir el corazón
Sin tanta pena, ahora te digo goodbye
Muito obrigado, pa' ti ya no hay

[Pre-Coro: Maluma]
Uooh uooh uohh, uooh uooh uohh
No tengo miedo de decir adiós
Yo quiero repartir meu coração

Uooh uooh uohh, uooh uooh uohh
Ahora te digo goodbye
Muito obrigado, pa' ti ya no hay
(Maluma, baby)

[Coro: Nego do Borel, Maluma]
Você partiu meu coração (Ai, meu coração)
Mas meu amor, não tem problema, não, não
Que agora vai sobrar então (O quê? O quê?)
Un pedacito a cada nena
Sólo un pedacito

[Puente: Nego do Borel]
Se eu não guardo nem dinheiro
Quem dirá guardar rancor
Você vacilou primeiro
Nosso caso acabou

Uooh uooh uohh, uooh uooh uohh
No tengo miedo de decir adiós
Yo quiero repartir meu coração

Uooh uooh uohh, uooh uooh uohh
Ahora te digo goodbye
Muito obrigado, pa' ti ya no hay

Pero mi amor no hay problema, no, no
Ahora puedo regalar (ya que, ya que), un pedacito a cada nena
Sólo un pedacito

[Outro: Maluma]
Tchau tchau
Eu não sei falar muito bem português
Mas quero aprender

Pretty boy, baby
Dirty boy, baby
Maluma, baby

Tú me partiste el corazón (Maluma, baby)
Pero mi amor no hay problema (Rudeboyz)
Sólo un pedacito

People like ""Damn, that's a cold ass honky!""
Rolling in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets (Pisssssss)
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents!
Bag it, copping it, washing it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passing up on those moccasins someone else been has walking in
Bummy and grudgy, fucking it, I am stunting and flossing and
Saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain bitch
Imma take your grandpa's style
Imma take your grandpa's style
No for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found, dig it
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my Mello
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like ""Ah, he got the Velcros!""

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

What you know about rocking a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowing about wearing a fur fox skin?
I'm digging, I'm digging, I'm searching right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donating that plaid button
Up shirt, 'cause right now, I'm up in here stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the (Uptons)
I'm that, I'm that sucker searching in this section (Uptons)
Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies, secondhand and rock that motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on that motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like ""Oh that Gucci, that's hella tight!""
I'm like ""Yo, that's fifty dollars for a t-shirt!""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a t-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting swindled and pimped, shit
I call that getting tricked by a business, that shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Trying to get girls from a brand, man, you hella won't
Man, you hella won't

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

I'll wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this big ass coat
From that thrift shop down the road

I wear your granddad's clothes (Damn right)
I look incredible (C'mon!)
I'm in this big ass coat (Big ass coat)
From that thrift shop down the road

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome",2020-08-29T16:58:25Z,505

De donde llegaste, ni pregunté
Lo único que sé, es que quiero con usted
Quedarme contigo hasta el amanecer
Como tú te llamas, yo no sé
De donde llegaste, ni pregunté
Lo único que sé, es que quiero con usted
Quedarme contigo hasta el amanecer
Óyeme mamacita, tu cuerpo y carita
Piel morena, lo que uno necesita
Mirando una chica tan bonita
Y pregunto porque anda tan sólita ven dale ahí ahí
moviendo todo eso pa' mí
No importa idioma ni el país
Ya vamonos de aquí, que tengo algo bueno para ti
Una noche de aventura hay que vivir
Óyeme ahí ahí, mami vamos a darle
Rumbeando y bebiendo a la vez
Tu tranquila que yo te daré
Una noche llena de placer

Como tú te llamas, yo no sé
De donde llegaste, ni pregunté
Lo único que sé, es que quiero con usted
Quedarme contigo hasta el amanecer
Yo pendiente a ti, como bailas así
Con ese movimiento me hipnotizas
Me voy acercando hacia ti y te digo suave al oído
Escúchame mami
Yo te estoy queriendo
Siento algo por dentro
Y tú me dices ""Estás muy loco, deja eso""
Mami yo te estoy queriendo
Siento algo por dentro
Me muero por llevarte
Como tú te llamas, yo no sé
De donde llegaste, ni pregunté
Lo único que sé, es que quiero con usted
Quedarme contigo hasta el amanecer
Como tú te llamas yo no sé
De donde llegaste, ni pregunté
Lo único que sé, es que quiero con usted
Quedarme contigo hasta el amanecer (hasta el amanecer)
Como tú te llamas yo no sé (no sé)
De donde llegaste, ni pregunté
Lo único que sé, es que quiero con usted
Quedarme contigo hasta el amanecer

"After everyone's last breath on earth, the soul (spirit) goes to a new place; that's either Heaven or Hell. 
How is heaven? heaven is a very good place with no sins, sorrows, crying, lust, greed; in other words there is no sin there and it’s full of joy.

How is hell? Matthew 13:50 (UKJV) “And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” Hell is very terrible and it’s very very hot, you can’t survive placing your hand on a hot stove for 10 seconds, don’t even think you will withstand burning there without being consumed,
The thing here is you will be burned without being consumed in hell the same same way you boil a hard rock in water you will be there for eternity,
Again after judgement you will be thrown in lake of fire forever. 

Hell is a place of suffering from intense tormenting, so why choose to go there instead of going to Heaven? 

Here is the steps you must read, understand and believe in order to be sure you will be on your way to Heaven. 

Salvation
Jesus said, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me"" (John 14:6). He also said, ""I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved"" (John 10:9, NASB). Jesus is not only the way to heaven, he is also the door to heaven. 
Realise you are a sinner; Isaiah 64:6 (UKJV) But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses(the quality of being morally right) are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.

Deserving hell for sins
Realise that you deserve hell for your sins; 
Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever. 

Repent
So repent, Repenting means: to change your mind; a sincere turning away, in heart, mind and action; Therefore God wants you to repent of sinful values and of sinful living. God wants you to decide to follow Him and to make Jesus the Lord of your life.

No other way 
If you want to go to heaven, you've got to go through the door marked ""Jesus Christ."" There is no other entrance. 
By no other entrance it means belief in gods, Buddha, Muhammad or other beings or objects cannot save you; But only belief in Jesus Christ our Lord can save you.
No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus did for you as simple as that. Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Believe 
All you need to do is to truly believe with your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ suffered and got crucified and shed his blood for your sins at the cross, He was buried but rose again on the third day just to prove he was God and now alive in heaven. After that you will receive the holy spirit and you will know that you are going to heaven after death or when Jesus comes back while you are still alive.

After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c. 
As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life. Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag.",2020-09-08T14:34:58Z,2

[Quavo:]
Yo, yo. Quavo
I'm the one that hit that same spot. Hit it.
She the one that bring them rain drops, rain drops.
We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch, hopscotch?
You the one that hold me down when the block's hot, hot.
I make your dreams come true when you wake up. Dream.
And your look's just the same without no make up, eh.
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of. Mama.
Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up, hey
You can run inside my life from that fame bus
'Cause I promise when we step out you'll be famous, yeah
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us. Why?
'Cause when we pull up—prr prr—all angles

Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watching Netflix, she ain't got no cable. Okay, though.
Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her
She want a nigga that pull her hair and hold the door for her
Baby, that's only me, bitch, it okay with me

Oh my God! She hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch you blow my high, that's like turning gold to bronze
Roll my eyes
And when she on the molly she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie but it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God forgive me
Tunechi and finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out The Crescent, fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula Gang winning record, I'm just flexing on my exes, oh, God

Roll my eyes
And when she on the molly she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie, but it's more like Whitney Bobby
God, forgive me
Tunechi and finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out The Crescent, fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula gang winning record, I'm just flexing on my exes, oh God!

Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie, no

"Lyrics:

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah)
To take a stand, it's been a ride
Everybody, I guess I had to
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road",2019-11-20T15:56:22Z,3011

"This song is simular to my life, accept its best friends, not gf and bf, if you want to know what happened, read more.





So, it all started a few years ago, I met people at my school and we became friends. and I met her my best friend ever.  My mom and dad always wanted to move since then, and they thought we were to young. Skip to a few years later, I had some more new friends, and then I met the liar friend. She always would try to replace my best friend by  agreeing with everything I say or saying we have a lot in common. She also would always wear the same outfit as me, without having any idea. I thought nothing of it so of course, I was friends with her to. Then I started playing with both of them, and then slowly faded out from her. A few years later, coronavirus started. At first we were fine, then school stopped. I had my bff’s number so I was fine. The problem is, I was moving. And since I’m popular at my school, people are gonna miss me a lot. So I started talking a lot to my bff over the phone, and FaceTimed, played roblox, and then I was a lot more into youtube. So I started always telling her “sorry I can’t talk to you right now I’m busy.” And it went on. Then I came back one day and said, “I can play roblox as long as you want now!” But then, I realized the last time we talked was a month ago. I kept on feeling sad, so I tried to ignore the fact that she won’t respond. A few days later, I found out the song “Dusk till dawn” was a thing. Now at first, I thought oh it’s just a nice beautiful song. Then I soon use it for one of my videos background music while I was editing. Then, when I was watching the video, I realized dusk till dawn was a song that seemed kinda similar to my friendship. So I started crying, nonstop that day, and I even told my friends about my friendship, so I basically cried the hole day. But then skip to a few days later again, since I’m a youtuber, I like editing. However, u decided to use gacha club to make a oc that looked like me. Then I made a edit of how I felt, ofc sad. Then the next day, I came across dusk till dawn again, and sent it to her. Skip to later, still no response, so I joined a game in roblox and talked to a girl, the game was a depressing game, ofc. So she came up to me and asked what was wrong. So I explained. After I explained she told me to move on, and she told me she probably forgot about me. I refused to believe so I kept trying. I kept saying things until I got to the point we’re I felt like she forgot about me. I kept saying nonsense, like “I don’t know why I try anymore.” So then I told my mother, and she said I should try to call her when her school was over. So I did, ofc again no response. So a few days later, I realized since I like editing, I should make a meme about are friendship, yes, a said meme. I have not posted it yet but I did make it. And I sent it to her. Keep in mind nos it’s been 2 months since we talked. I told her to listen to it with sound on. I hope she sees it. Time to wait patiently..",2020-09-06T20:22:03Z,7

When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah...

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

[Verse 2]
We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine

[Chorus]
So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

[Refrain]
Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

[Bridge]
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Refrain]
Sometimes, I need some time on my own
Sometimes, I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Verse 3]
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ooh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame

We still can find a way

"Guns N' Roses - November Rain (Official Music Video)

Lyrics:

When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin' when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same?

Nothin' lasts forever
And we both know heart can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

We've been through this such a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain
Oh yeah

But love is always coming 
And love is always going
And no one's really sure of who's lettin' go today
Walking away

If we could take the time
To lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
All mine

So if you want to love me
Then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

Do you need some time
On your own?
Do you need some time
All alone?

Everybody needs some time
On their own
Don't you know you need some time
All alone?

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you?

(Slash Guitar Solo)

Sometimes I need some time
On my own
Sometimes I need some time
All alone

Everybody needs some time
On their own
Don't you know you need some time
All alone?

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain
Oh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame

So never mind the darkness:
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain

Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody

You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody

You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?

"Hola 👋🏻, en estos tiempos tan difíciles por los que estamos pasando, no vengo a decirte algo que te llenará de ansiedad, 😩 nervios o incertidumbre, vengo a recordarte algo muy importante con lo que espero alegrar tu día😃🌞:

Quiéreme mientras se pueda 💖 
que la vida es una rueda que te da mil vueltas 🎡
Y al final nada queda
no he visto la primera historia 📖 
de que alguien se muere ⚰️ y algo se lleva 🤑💸
y lo mejor de esta historia 📚 
es que tú eres mi compañer@ 👩‍❤️‍👨👬👭
de esta vida pasajera

quiéreme mientras yo te quiera 💓 
y no quiere decir que seas mí@
por eso guardo buenos recuerdos 💭 en la alcancía 🐖
para recordarte por si te vas algún día
esto ha sido una poesía 📖 
que escribimos los dos 👫
únicos, en cada capítulo
me quieres antes que yo👩‍❤️‍👨
son cosas del destino
gracias a Dios 🙏🙏 que nos juntó en el camino

Aunque te quiera pa’ la eternidad 👨🏼‍🦳👵🏼
todo en la vida tiene su principio y su final 👻
tú y yo no somos la excepción
no te sientas mal 🙁
y si me voy que seas feliz 😊😊 antes de llorar
por eso quiéreme en vida 😍🥰
vivamos los días
haciendo una historia de las que no se olvidan 😁🥰🤡💯💌⛷️👪👣🍂🌇🌅
he visto el amor disfrazado de hipocresía
el bolsillo lleno con cabezas vacías 🤪 

Hay amores tan tóxicos ☣️
que nadie los entiende
no son lógicos 🤷
pero cuando el amor es entre dos 👩‍❤️‍👨
las mariposas 🦋no son cólico.

"Sé que buscas a alguien que
Te vuelva a enamorar
Que no te haga sentir mal
Sé que hubo otro que
No supo valorar
Lo que tenías para dar
Sé que tal vez
Te hizo sufrir
Te hizo llorar
Te supo lastimar
Sé que tal vez
Ya sabes de mí
Voy detrás de ti
No te voy a mentir
Voy buscando una lady
Como tú la quiero así
Quiero que te enamores
Como estoy yo de ti
A casa enviarte flores
Y en tu nombre escribir
Mil canciones de amores
Pa' que pienses en mí
Como yo pienso en ti
Yo quiero hablarte
Quiero hipnotizarte
Un estrella traerte
Hasta el cielo bajarte
Cantarte al oído
Y ver tu piel al erizarte
Llevarte lentamente
donde estemos tu y yo aparte
Y si te provoca
Te beso la boca
Sueño con tocarte
Quitarte la ropa
No confundas mi intención
Por decir cosas locas
Te quiero
Pero tu cuerpo también me provoca
Poderte complacer
Cada uno de tus sueños conocer
Hablar juntos hasta el amanecer
Que seas mi mujer
Sea yo el único que te de placer
Cada día de mi vida yo poderte tener
Voy buscando una lady
Como tú la quiero así
Quiero que te enamores
Como estoy yo de ti
A casa enviarte flores
Y en tu nombre escribir
Mil canciones de amores
Pa' que pienses en mí
Como yo pienso en ti (X2)
Sé que buscas a alguien que
Te vuelva a enamorar
Que no te haga sentir mal
Sé que hubo otro que no supo valorar
Lo que tenías para dar
Voy buscando una lady
Como tú la quiero así
Quiero que te enamores
Como estoy yo de ti
A casa enviarte flores
Y en tu nombre escribir
Mil canciones de amores
Pa' que pienses en mí
Como yo pienso en ti

"De verdad me gusta mucho esta canción por qué.....

Hace unos 2 casi 3 meses mi hermano sufrió una fuerte pelea que lo dejo en coma, ya se estaba recuperando y podía hablar y moverse pero por alguna razón no lo querían dar de alta.

Yo era de leí que siempre después de la escuela (voy en la tarde) iba a verlo al hospital y estaba con el haciendo muchas cosas, hablaba con el, me reía con el, lloraba con el y hubo un día en el que estábamos escuchando música.

Y me dijo ""pon la de una lady como tú"" y la puse y ambos no la sabíamos de memoria y juntos la cantamos, hubo un momento en que se quedó callado y yo seguía cantando, y en la parte de

""Voy buscando una Lady, como tú la quiero así"" el lo que hizo fue señalarme, osea como dedicándome esa parte de la canción y yo por la emoción me puse a llorar y lo abracé.

Se fue acercando a mi y me susurro al oído 

""Quiero que sepas que eres el amor de mi vida,pero en hermana"" 

Al día siguiente mi hermano falleció, nunca se supo de qué manera o cuál fue la causa si estaba mejorando.

Al escuchar esta canción me hace acordarme de el y de ese tan bonito momento que me gustaría repetir más de mil veces.

Te amo infinitamente hermanito 🥺❤",2020-02-02T20:55:08Z,1900

"Lyrics:
""Burn""

We, we don't have to worry 'bout nothing
'Cause we got the fire, and we're burning one hell of a something
They, they gonna see us from outer space, outer space
Light it up, like we're the stars of the human race, human race

When the light started out they don’t know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

We don't wanna leave, no. We just wanna be right now (right), r-r-right now
And what we see is everybody's on the floor acting crazy, getting loco 'til the lights out
Music's on, I'm waking up, we fight the fire, then we burn it up
And it's over now, we got the love, there's no sleeping now, no sleeping now, no sleeping

When the light started out they don’t know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

When the light started out they don’t know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world

We gonna let it burn burn burn burn (burn burn)
Burn burn burn burn (burn burn)

We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out

When the light started out they don’t know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

When the light started out they don’t know what they heard

"LYRICS
We, we don't have to worry 'bout nothin'
'Cause we got the fire, and we're burning one hell of a something
They, they gonna see us from outer space
Light it up, like we're the stars of the human race
When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire, yeah we got the fire, fire, fire
And we're gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We're gonna let it burn, burn, burn
We're gonna let it burn
Oh, we're gonna let it burn
We don't wanna leave, no, we just wanna be right now
And what we see, is everybody's on the floor
Acting crazy, getting loco to the lights out
Music's on, I'm waking up, we start the fire, and we burn it out
And it's over now, oh we got the love, there's no secret now
When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire, yeah we got the fire, fire, fire

"Ba-Ba-Babylon girl, Ba-Ba-Babylon girl
Para todos aquellos amores que
Fueron obligados a ser separados
Ba-Ba-Babylon girl, Ba-Ba-Babylon girl
Esta canción es para ti

Dime cómo le explico a mi destino que ya no estás ahí
Dime cómo haré para desprenderme de este frenesí
Esta locura que siento por ti
Con esta química que haces en mí
Ya no puedo, girl, ya no puedo, girl

Nena, discúlpame
Y si te ilusioné, yo no lo quise hacer
Sé que en el amor cuando es real
Ese vuelve, vuelve (vuelve, vuelve, vuelve)
Pero ¿cómo olvidar tu piel?
¿Y cómo olvidarte, mujer?
Ya no puedo, girl, ya no puedo, girl

Baby, no (baby, no)
Me rehúso a darte un último beso
Así que guárdalo (guárdalo)
Para que la próxima vez
Te lo dé haciéndolo (haciéndolo)
Haciéndotelo así, así, así
Así como te gusta, baby

Sin mirar atrás, sin buscar a nadie más
Solo quiero estar contigo, uoh
Si no te tengo aquí conmigo, ya no quiero ser tu amigo
Porque tú eres mi camino, uoh

Y yo solo quiero estar junto a ti
Nena, por favor, entiéndelo
Solo dame tu mano y confía en mí
Si te pierdes, solo sigue mi voz

Y dale tiempo (tiempo), mami, al tiempo
Que tú, que yo, estamos hechos para estar los dos
Y dale tiempo (dale tiempo), baby, al tiempo
Que tú y yo, que tú y yo estamos hechos para estar los dos

Baby, no (baby, no)
Me rehúso a darte un último beso
Así que guárdalo (guárdalo)
Para que la próxima vez
Te lo dé haciéndolo (haciéndolo)
Haciéndotelo así, así, así (así, así)
Así como te gusta, baby

Baby, no (baby, no)
Me rehúso a darte un último beso
Así que guárdalo (guárdalo)
Para que la próxima vez
Te lo dé haciéndolo
Haciéndotelo así, así, así
Así como te gusta, baby

Así, así, así como te gusta, baby

Baby, no (baby, no)
Me rehúso a darte un último beso
Así que guárdalo (guárdalo)
Para que la próxima vez
Te lo dé haciéndolo
Haciéndotelo así, así, así
Así como te gusta, baby

Baby, no (baby, no)
Me rehúso a darte un último beso
Así que guárdalo (guárdalo)
Para que la próxima vez
Te lo dé haciéndolo
Haciéndotelo así, así
Así como te gusta, baby",2020-08-18T21:01:16Z,59

"Letra:
Nada voy a hacer 
Rebuscando en las heridas del pasado 
No voy a perder 
Yo no quiero ser un tipo de otro lado
A tu manera, descomplicado 
En una bici que te lleve a todos lados 
Un vallenato desesperado 
Una cartica que yo guardo donde te escribí 
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto 
Que hace rato está mi corazón 
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti 
La que yo guardo donde te escribí 
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto 
Que hace rato está mi corazón 
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti
Puedo ser feliz 
Caminando relajada entre la gente 
Yo te quiero así 
Y me gustas porque eres diferente
A mi manera, despelucado 
En una bici que me lleva a todos lados 
Un vallenato desesperado 
Una cartica que yo guardo donde te escribí 
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto 
Que hace rato está mi corazón 
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti 
La que yo guardo donde te escribí 
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto 
Que hace rato está mi corazón 
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti
Ella es la favorita, la que canta en la zona 
Se mueve en su cadera como un barco en las olas 
Tiene los pies descalzos como un niño que adora 
Y sus cabellos largos son un sol que te antoja 
Le gusta que le digan que es la niña, la lola 
Le gusta que la miren cuando ella baila sola 
Le gusta más la casa, que no pasen las horas 
Le gusta Barranquilla, le gusta Barcelona
Lleva, llévame en tu bicicleta 
Óyeme, Carlos, llévame en tu bicicleta 
Quiero que recorramos juntos esa zona 
Desde Santa Marta hasta La Arenosa 
Lleva, llévame en tu bicicleta 
Pa' que juguemos bola 'e trapo allá en Chancleta 
Que si a Pique algún día le muestras el Tayrona 
Después no querrá irse pa' Barcelona
A mi manera, descomplicado 
En una bici que me lleva a todos lados 
Un vallenato desesperado 
Una cartica que yo guardo donde te escribí 
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto 
Que hace rato está mi corazón 
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti 
La que yo guardo donde te escribí 
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto 
Que hace rato está mi corazón 
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti
Lleva, llévame en tu bicicleta 
Óyeme, Carlos, llévame en tu bicicleta 
Que sí a Pique algún día le muestras el Tayrona 
Después no querrá irse pa' Barcelona 
Lleva, llévame en tu bicicleta 
Óyeme, Carlos, llévame en tu bicicleta

Después no querrá irse pa' Barcelona",2020-07-12T00:17:24Z,328

"Shakira es la reina del pop latino, ninguna/o ha logrado tanto impacto mundial, a tal punto que ""compite"" codo a codo con estrellas como Rihanna, Britney Spears y Beyoncé... 
Es la única latina que saca sus hits en ambos idiomas, así como Loba/She Wolf... Loca... Waka Waka... Suerte/Whenever wherever... Gitana/Gypsy... Te aviso te anuncio/Objection... 
60 millones de discos vendidos, 3 mundiales consecutivos, 2 giras consecutivas con localidades agotadas, Fue la primera en llegar a los 100 millones de ""Likes"" en su página oficial de Facebook...  Hips Dont Lie es la canción mas exitosa del siglo 21. y por si fuera poco, está por romper otro record, en YouTube está por superar los 7000 millones de reproducciones de sus videos oficiales.
Perdonen si sus ídolos latinos son otros, pero la verdadera reina indiscutible está en este video, y se llama Shakira Shakira!",2016-10-24T17:27:01Z,5571

"Nothing i will do
Nada voy a hacer

Digging into the wounds of the past
Rebuscando en las heridas del pasado

I'm not gonna lose
No voy a perder

I don't want to be a guy from the other side
Yo no quiero ser un tipo de otro lado

In your own way, uncomplicated
A tu manera, descomplicado

On a bike that takes you everywhere
En una bici que te lleve a todos lados

A desperate vallenato
Un vallenato desesperado

A letter that I keep where I wrote you
Una cartica que yo guardo donde te escribí

That I dream of you and that I love you so much
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto

My heart has been around for a long time
Que hace rato está mi corazón

Beating for you, beating for you
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti

The one that I keep where I wrote you
La que yo guardo donde te escribí

That I dream of you and that I love you so much
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto

My heart has been around for a long time
Que hace rato está mi corazón

Beating for you, beating for you
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti

I can be happy
Puedo ser feliz

Walking relaxed among the people
Caminando relajada entre la gente

I want you like that
Yo te quiero así

And I like you because you are different
Y me gustas porque eres diferente

In my own way, shaggy
A mi manera, despelucado

On a bike that takes me everywhere
En una bici que me lleva a todos lados

A desperate vallenato
Un vallenato desesperado

A letter that I keep where I wrote you
Una cartica que yo guardo donde te escribí

That I dream of you and that I love you so much
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto

My heart has been around for a long time
Que hace rato está mi corazón

Beating for you, beating for you
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti

The one that I keep where I wrote you
La que yo guardo donde te escribí

That I dream of you and that I love you so much
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto

My heart has been around for a long time
Que hace rato está mi corazón

Beating for you, beating for you
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti

She is the favorite, the one who sings in the area
Ella es la favorita, la que canta en la zona

Moves on your hip like a ship on the waves
Se mueve en su cadera como un barco en las olas

He has bare feet like a child who adores
Tiene los pies descalzos como un niño que adora

And her long hair is a sun that you crave
Y sus cabellos largos son un sol que te antoja

He likes to be told that it is the girl, the lola
Le gusta que le digan que es la niña, la lola

She likes to be seen when she dances alone
Le gusta que la miren cuando ella baila sola

He likes the house better, that the hours do not pass
Le gusta más la casa, que no pasen las horas

He likes Barranquilla, he likes Barcelona
Le gusta Barranquilla, le gusta Barcelona

Take me, take me on your bike
Lleva, llévame en tu bicicleta

Listen to me, Carlos, take me on your bike
Óyeme, Carlos, llévame en tu bicicleta

I want us to travel that area together
Quiero que recorramos juntos esa zona

From Santa Marta to La Arenosa
Desde Santa Marta hasta La Arenosa

Take me, take me on your bike
Lleva, llévame en tu bicicleta

So that we play ball and rag there in Chancleta
Pa' que juguemos bola 'e trapo allá en Chancleta

What if one day you show Pique the Tayrona
Que si a Pique algún día le muestras el Tayrona

Then you will not want to go to Barcelona
Después no querrá irse pa' Barcelona

In my own way, uncomplicated
A mi manera, descomplicado

On a bike that takes me everywhere
En una bici que me lleva a todos lados

A desperate vallenato
Un vallenato desesperado

A letter that I keep where I wrote you
Una cartica que yo guardo donde te escribí

That I dream of you and that I love you so much
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto

My heart has been around for a long time
Que hace rato está mi corazón

Beating for you, beating for you
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti

The one that I keep where I wrote you
La que yo guardo donde te escribí

That I dream of you and that I love you so much
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto

My heart has been around for a long time
Que hace rato está mi corazón

Beating for you, beating for you
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti

Take me, take me on your bike
Lleva, llévame en tu bicicleta

Listen to me, Carlos, take me on your bike
Óyeme, Carlos, llévame en tu bicicleta

Yes to Pique someday you will show him the Tayrona
Que sí a Pique algún día le muestras el Tayrona

Then you will not want to go to Barcelona
Después no querrá irse pa' Barcelona

Take me, take me on your bike
Lleva, llévame en tu bicicleta

Listen to me, Carlos, take me on your bike
Óyeme, Carlos, llévame en tu bicicleta

What if you show my Pique the Tayrona
Que si a mi Pique tú le muestras el Tayrona

Then you will not want to go to Barcelona
Después no querrá irse pa' Barcelona",2020-08-31T08:39:37Z,12

La niña respondió con una fuerte voz enojada; ""¡¡No quiero pasar la noche contigo !!
 Toda la gente de la biblioteca empezó a mirar al chico y se sintió avergonzado.
Después de unos minutos la chica caminó tranquilamente hacia la mesa del chico y le dijo: estudio psicología y sé lo que está pensando el hombre, supongo que te sentiste avergonzado, ¿no?
El chico respondió en voz alta: $ 300 por una noche ¡Eso es demasiado! y todas las personas en la biblioteca miraron a la chica en estado de shock y el chico le susurró al oído,

You came to lift me up
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river, dried up
You came to rain a flood

Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

But it flew away from her reach and the bullets catch in her teeth

Dont ask who's still here in 2020 cause real OGs NEVER LEFT!,2020-08-28T17:11:47Z,199
"Like from my point of view:
1.The kid probably had some superpowers that he didnt know of and had some problems at school and he accidentaly caused that chaos inside and fainted so the teachers got scared and decided to call the police thinking that he can harm them.
2. The kid had no idea what happened and obviously felt bad and when he saw the cop outside he rushed home to get away from everyone but there he was, on the TV, and he knew that police would be after him. Again, he probably felt really bad and very scared and decided to go away even further but then police and special forces chased him in the forest, so when they caught him, he didn't give up and he just let his feelings free and he knocked them down..
3.So the point of the video is that the kid is really strong like titanium and that he wont give up on himself no matter what happens: ""you shot me down, but I wont fall"" which is supposed to be an inspiration for people => no matter how much ups and downs you have in your life, you should never give up and you should keep fighting until u succeed.",2014-06-25T16:49:19Z,4276

"Ah ah
Dime si es verdad
Me dijeron que te estás casando
Tú no sabes lo que estoy sufriendo
Esto te lo tengo que decir
Cuéntame
Tu despedida para mí fue dura
Será que él te llevó a la luna
Y yo no supe hacerlo así
Te estaba buscando
Por la calle gritando
Esto me está matando, oh no
Te estaba buscando
Por la calle gritando
Como un loco tomando, oh
Es que yo sin ti, y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta
Es que yo sin ti, y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta
Yo sin ti, no aguanto más
Por eso vengo a decirte lo que siento
Estoy sufriendo en la soledad
Y aunque tu padre no aprobó esta relación
Yo sigo insistiendo a pedir perdón
Lo único que importa está en tu corazón
Te estaba buscando
Por la calle gritando
Esto me está matando, oh no
Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Como un loco tomando oh
Es que yo sin ti, y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta
Es que yo sin ti, y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Eso no me gusta
Yo te juré a ti ese eterno amor
Y ahora otro te da calor
Cuando en las noches tienes frío oh oh, oh
Yo sé que él te parece mejor
Pero yo estoy en tu corazón
Y por eso pido perdón
Es que yo sin ti, y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta
Es que yo sin ti, y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
oh yeah, oh oh
Dicen que uno no sabe lo que tiene hasta que lo pierde pero
(Yo sin ti) Vale la pena luchar por lo que uno quiere
(No puedo vivir así) Y hacer el intento
(No quiero vivir así)

"Canción en inglés:
Lo puse con el traductor de Google, y pueden haber palabras cambiadas
song in English: I translated it with the translator so some words are changed:
ahhh
 tell me if it's true,
They told me that you are getting married, 
You don't know what I'm suffering and I have to tell you this,
 Tell me
 Your farewell to me was hard,
 Will it take you to the moon?
 And I don't know what to do without you 
I was looking for you,
 down the street screaming, This is killing me,
 oh no 
I was looking for you,
 down the street screaming,
 like crazy taking,
 ohhhhhh,
Is that I without you, and you without me, 
tell me who wants to be happy? 
I do not like this, 
I do not like this 
Is that I without you, and you without me,
 tell me who wants to be happy?
 I do not like this,
 I do not like this 
is that living without you, 
I can not take anymore, 
that's why i come to tell you how I feel,
 I'm suffering in this loneliness 
ohhh 
and although your father did not approve of this relationship, 
I keep insisting to ask for forgiveness, 
The only thing that matters is in your heart 
I was looking for you,
 down the street screaming,
 this is killing me, ohh 
I was looking for you,
 down the street screaming,
 like crazy drinking,
 ohhhh
is that I without you, and you without me,
 tell me who wants to be happy? 
I do not like this,
I do not like this
is that I without you, and you without me,
tell me who wants to be happy? 
I do not like this,
I don't like this, 
ahhh
I swore to you eternal love, And now another gives you heat, 
when the nights are cold,
 ohhh ohh,
I know who you think is best, but I am in your heart,
So I apologize
is that I without you, and you without me,
Tell me who wants to be happy?
 I do not like this,
 I do not like this, 
is that I without you, and you without me,
tell me who wants to be happy?
 I don't like this
 ahhh ahh.",2020-06-01T02:05:37Z,5

"Ya yo me cansé, no quiero ser tu amante
Te digo de mi parte
Que no aguanto más
Ya no aguanto ver el otro cómo dice que es el dueño tuyo
Me mata el orgullo
Él ni te sabe hablar
Esta la hice pa' él
Cuando la escuche, quiero estar ahí para ver
Cuando se entere y sepa que soy dueño de usted
Tal vez suene un poco mal, lo sé y no me luce
Todo es por usted
Mami yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te sientes mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que con él te sientes fría
Mami yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te sientes mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que él es una porquería
Te caliento más, más, más
Te caliento más, más, más
Te caliento más, más, más
Te caliento más, más, más
Te caliento más
Solo una cosa te preguntaré
Si tienes frío, ¿quién te da calor?
Yo soy el dueño de tu fantasía
Nadie lo hace como yo
Si te vistes bonita, él no te dice na'
Y a mí tú me gustas hasta sin maquillar
Tú siempre a mí me dices que él te trata mal
Y eso lo tienes que acabar
Dime qué tú vas a hacer
Mami tengo la inquietud
Si quieres sufrir con él
Eso lo decides tú
Que seas feliz con él
Yo no te contestaré
Sé que me vas a llamar
Cuando me extrañe tu piel
Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te sientes mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que con él te sientes fría
Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te sientes mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que él es una porquería
Esta la hice pa' él
Cuando la escuche, quiero estar ahí para ver
Cuando se entere y sepa que soy dueño de usted
Tal vez suene un poco mal lo sé y no me luce
Todo es por usted
Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te sientes mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que con él te sientes fría
Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te sientes mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que él es una porquería
Te caliento más, más, más
Te caliento más, más, más
Te caliento más, más, más
Te caliento más, más, más
Te caliento más
Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te sientes mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo

"*Respecto al problema de fandoms La verdad es que no solo lo hacen con BTS y BLACKPINK, hace años yo era fan de dos grupos y sucedió lo mismo, seguidores de otros grupos se hicieron pasar por fans de los grupos que me gustaban y entonces se tiraban hate y los verdaderos fans se la creían y comenzaba una ola de odio entre ambos. Además cabe recalcar que no solo son fans otros grupos los que arman todo eso, si no que también son anti fans del Kpop, para ser precisa el KPOP en general, gente que no tiene nada que ver y desconocen la música surcoreana. Así que la única forma de detener esto es: No hacer caso, enserio gente, si una persona te insulta, no hagas nada, ya verás el ridículo que hace el otro al hablar solo. Responder un insulto es aceptar lo que dicen de ti. Solo agranda el problema. Así que este problema con hacerse pasar por fans no es de ahora. Ya viene de tiempo.*

Espero que las Blinks o Armys que lean esto. Tomen conciencia de lo que causan al responder los insultos. Sea cual sea sus motivos o que tan fuerte se sienta el odio. Sé que hay muchas fans de  12 o 13 años , Enserio son muy mal vistas o tildadas de inmaduras traten de llevar su fanatismo a un nivel de respeto y apoyo en sus grupos favoritos.

"Blackpink (Hangul: 블랙핑크; commonly stylized as BLACKPINK or BLΛƆKPIИK) is a South Korean girl group formed by YG Entertainment, consisting of members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa. The group debuted on August 8, 2016, with their single album Square One, which spawned ""Whistle"", their first number-one song in South Korea, as well as ""Boombayah"", their first number-one hit on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart. With the group's early commercial success, they were hailed as the New Artist of the Year at the 31st Golden Disc Awards and the 26th Seoul Music Awards. As of 2019, Blackpink is the highest-charting female K-pop act on both Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard 200, peaking at number 41 with ""Kill This Love"", and peaking at number 24 with Kill This Love, respectively. They are also the first and only K-pop girl group to enter and top Billboard's Emerging Artists chart. They are also the first female K-pop group to have four number-one singles on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart. At the time of its release, ""Ddu-Du Ddu-Du"" was the most-viewed Korean music video in the first 24 hours on YouTube, and in January 2019, it became the most viewed music video by a K-pop group on the website. As of September 2019, Blackpink is the most-subscribed music group on YouTube.

"blinkssssssssss we did it 1 hour ago soompi made this article:
BLACKPINK is the only Korean artist included in Rolling Stone’s list of “10 Best Music Videos of 2018”!

The magazine recently published its annual list of the year’s top music videos. This year, BLACKPINK placed No. 8 with their hit track “DDU-DU DDU-DU.”

Rolling Stone praised the “DDU-DU DDU-DU” music video as “a feat of bonkers, maximalist creativity” and compared the girl group’s use of their iconic tank in the music video to the one in Master P’s “Make ‘Em Say Uhh.” The publication also noted that director Seo Hyun Seung, who is responsible for many of YG’s most popular music videos, didn’t hesitate to add his spectacular touch to this music video as well.

The “DDU-DU DDU-DU” music video was recently named the fastest K-pop music video to reach 550 million views and is known for having the highest official 24 hour views ever for a K-pop music video. It also has second highest official 24 hour views among all music videos in YouTube history.

Other music videos to make the list include The Carters’ (Jay-Z and Beyoncé) “Apeshit,” Childish Gambino’s “This Is America,” and Drake’s “God’s Plan.”

Congratulations to BLACKPINK!",2018-12-20T09:05:53Z,537

"(LYRICS)
Tonight
I just want to take you higher
Throw your hands up in the sky
Let's set this party off right

Players, put yo' pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all trying to do?
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Uh, look out!

Pop pop, it's show time (Show time)
Show time (Show time)
Guess who's back again?
Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
I bet they know soon as we walk in
(Showin' up)
Wearing Cuban links (ya)
Designer minks (ya)
Inglewood's finest shoes (Whoop, whoop)
Don't look too hard
Might hurt ya'self
Known to give the color red the blues

Ooh shit, I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket
(Keep up)
So many pretty girls around me and they waking up the rocket
(Keep up)
Why you mad? Fix ya face
Ain't my fault y'all be jocking
(Keep up)

Players only, come on
Put your pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all trying to do?
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Uh, look out!

Second verse for the hustlas (hustlas)
Gangstas (gangstas)
Bad bitches and ya ugly ass friends (Haha)
Can I preach? (Uh oh) Can I preach? (Uh oh)
I gotta show 'em how a pimp get it in
First, take your sip (sip), do your dip (dip)
Spend your money like money ain't shit (Whoop, whoop)
We too fresh
Got to blame it on Jesus
Hashtag blessed
They ain't ready for me

I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket
(Keep up)
So many pretty girls around me and they waking up the rocket
(Keep up)
Why you mad? Fix ya face
Ain't my fault y'all be jocking
(Keep up)

Players only, come on
Put your pinky rings up to the moon
Hey girls
What y'all trying to do?
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Uh, look out!

(Wooh)
Everywhere I go they be like
Ooh, so player ooh
Everywhere I go they be like
Ooh, so player ooh
Everywhere I go they be like
Ooh, so player ooh
Now, now, now
Watch me break it down like (Uh)
24 karat, 24 karat magic
What's that sound?
24 karat, 24 karat magic
Come on now
24 karat, 24 karat magic
Don't fight the feeling
Invite the feeling

Just put your pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all trying to do?
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Put your pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all trying to do? (Do)

"Ey
Ozuna! 
Doble U
Será la magia que tienen tus ojos 
Y esos truquitos para enamorar 
Tú me seduces a tu antojo 
Y de tu hechizo no puedo escapar
Qué ganas tengo de buscarte 
Y de volverte a besar 
Por más que traten de alejarte 
Baby hoy conmigo tú te vas
Yo solo quiero que confíes en mí
Y seas valiente, bebé
Escápate conmigo esta noche, bebé 
Te quiero comer, te va a encantar 
Tú sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien 
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar 
Bebé no digas que no
Si solo somos tú y yo 
Y se te eriza la piel
Cuando entramos en calor
Bebé no digas que no
Si solo somos tú y yo 
Y se te eriza la piel
Cuando entramos en calor
Mi super nova, la que una sonrisa me roba 
Tremenda loba, solo un beso y calienta la alcoba 
Se me pega y me soba, no se incomoda 
La baby es una pantera, yo soy su Casanova
Escápate conmigo, donde no hayan testigos 
Si te preguntan, dile que soy tu mejor amigo 
Yo quiero un beso, tu quieres castigo 
Sabes que no te obligo, te deseo, siempre te lo digo (Mamita deja la ventana abierta)
Escápate conmigo esta noche, bebé 
Te quiero comer, te va a encantar 
Tú sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien 
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar
Es que yo quiero un poco más, de tu rica desnudez 
Es que el sudor de tu piel, es el que yo quiero probar 
Es que yo quiero un poco más, de tu rica desnudez 
Es que el sudor de tu piel, es el que yo quiero probar
Baby andamos con los poderes 
Ozuna
Mi mente descontrola 
Y si la llamo ella me dice que la busque que está sola 
Que no hay tiempo, pero haciéndolo se demora 
Si le fallo, que tranquilo por que no se enamora
Tranquila, la vida conmigo te lo vacilas 
Que no he visto otra baby, de tu liga 
Esos besitos que me dan ganas 
De amanecer contigo todas las mañanas
Escápate conmigo esta noche, bebé 
Te quiero comer, te va a encantar 
Tú sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien 
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar
Beé no digas que no, si solo somos tú y yo 
Y se te eriza la piel, cuando entramos en calor 
Bebé no digas que no, si solo somos tú y yo 
Y se te eriza la piel, cuando entramos en calor

La niña respondió con una fuerte voz enojada; ""¡¡No quiero pasar la noche contigo !!
 Toda la gente de la biblioteca empezó a mirar al chico y se sintió avergonzado.
Después de unos minutos la chica caminó tranquilamente hacia la mesa del chico y le dijo: estudio psicología y sé lo que está pensando el hombre, supongo que te sentiste avergonzado, ¿no?
El chico respondió en voz alta: $ 300 por una noche ¡Eso es demasiado! y todas las personas en la biblioteca miraron a la chica en estado de shock y el chico le susurró al oído,

I'd rather break up with someone before cheating, that is just something that will only hurt them more than a break up, if someone cheats on you she/he clearly doesn't love you back, and for me, that would be enough to just quit trying, because everyone deserves better than this. ",2014-11-18T22:35:15Z,2567
"You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts

For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

"I woke up around 6am with my man still asleep next to me. I took a phone from the table next to my bed thinking it was mine. Then I read the message on the notification saying, ""See you before lunch. I miss you baby. -unregistered number"". My heart sank realizing it was his phone. My hands started shaking but after a few minutes I started preparing and then went to work. By lunch time I decided to take the rest of the day off. I went home and saw an unfamiliar car leaving our parking space. I went into our apartment and found him cleaning up everything. He froze in shock seeing me. I came close and kissed his forehead and softly whispered to him, ""It's okay. I know I'm not the only one.""
That was the 3rd and final time I cared. I'm getting my life back together now. I'll be okay without him. 🙃",2020-08-20T16:44:23Z,428

"Was with married for 10 years. Together for over 12 years. We have 3 beautiful kids. I cook, I clean, I take care of our kids, I have a good Job. Was able to buy our first house together. Everything seemed perfect but I always had my doubts. There were signs of infidelity but she kept telling me I was crazy and lied about everything. Just kept piling up the lies for about a year. I hated myself for having doubts on the woman i've been with for a third of my life. Came to the point I found enough evidence and I begged her to tell me the truth. She continued to lie but finally confessed. Being cheated on has been the hardest thing I've ever been through. It still hurts and even though I say I've moved on; I don't think I will ever be 100%. If you want to be with someone else please end your current relationship first. Cheating is not fun and it definitely isn't fair. Needless to say I listen to this song everyday and for some odd reason it helps.",2018-12-04T13:45:08Z,12911

My second breakup this year seated on the toilet seat still crying while listening to this song 😢. 'you've made me realise my deepest fear'😭😭,2020-08-03T19:11:29Z,33
"I found out my wife cheated on me in July of 2019. The divorce was officially settled in September. We had been married since 2007 and had known each other since 9th grade. I had suspicions that she had been cheating on me,  but she constantly told me I was being insecure or worrying for no reason. I went along with it for a while, but something didn’t feel right. She was coming home late, she didn’t show me the same level of affection, would never let me see her phone, and she was always “busy.” She’d been cheating on me since 2015, but I let my love and trust for her blind me. She took advantage of me and my kindness. The pain I felt listening to this song and the way I was able to relate to it made me cry more than I ever have in my life, and that crying made me feel better than I ever have. The morale of the story here is: 1) Never let people take advantage of your kindness 2) make sure you choose the right person when you are looking for a relationship, what I mean is make sure both of you are on the same page. When one person in the relationship is more loving and affectionate than the other, the relationship is doomed from the start, and 3) it’s ok to cry, it feels amazing. 

Take care and have an amazing 2020.",2020-01-07T00:57:35Z,11719

"There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbecue

This a hickey or a bruise?
Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled, damn

Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
Oh whoa

This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credits card
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevards

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
Oh whoa

This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night

"Lyrics: 
 I thought that I've been hurt before

But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
I'm tripping over myself
Aching begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
I'm tripping over myself
Aching begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

"Lyrics: 

 I thought that I've been hurt before

But no one's ever left me quite this sore

Your words cut deeper than a knife

Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under

But I know that I'll make it out alive

If I quit calling you my lover

Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe

I'm shaking falling onto my knees

And now that I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches

I'm tripping over myself

Aching begging you to come help

And now that I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame

Oh you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain

Your bitter heart cold to the touch

Now I'm gonna reap what I sow

I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under

But I know that I'll make it out alive

If I quit calling you my lover

Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe

I'm shaking falling onto my knees

And now that I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches

I'm tripping over myself

Aching begging you to come help

And now that I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches

Needle and the thread

Gotta get you out of my head

Needle and the thread

Gonna wind up dead

Needle and the thread

Gotta get you out of my head

Needle and the thread

Gonna wind up dead

Needle and the thread

Gotta get you out of my head

Needle and the thread

Gonna wind up dead

Needle and the thread

Gotta get you out of my head, get you out of my head

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe

I'm shaking falling onto my knees (falling on my knees)

And now that I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches (and I'll be needing stitches)

I'm tripping over myself

Aching begging you to come help (begging baby please)

And now that I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches

And now that I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches

And now that I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches

I have all the best memories I could wish for it. That's why I will always celebrate Lady Gaga. She is more than a pop icon, she is and always will be a inspiration to all of us. 💗🌈",2020-09-04T04:50:15Z,138

Súbeme la radio
Trá-tráeme el alcohol

Súbeme la radio que esta es mi canción
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tráeme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol

Súbeme la radio que esta es mi canción
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tráeme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol

Ya no me importa nada
Ni el día, ni la hora
Si lo he perdido todo
Me has dejado en las sombras

Te juro que te pienso
Hago el mejor intento
El tiempo pasa lento
Y yo me voy muriendo
(Y yo me voy muriendo)

Si llega la noche y tú no contestas
Te juro, me quedo esperando a tu puerta
Vivo pasando las noches en vela
Y sigo cantando bajo la luna llena

Súbeme la radio que esta es mi canción
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tráeme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol

Súbeme la radio que esta es mi canción
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tráeme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol

Huyendo del pasado
En cada madrugada
No encuentro ningún modo
De borrar nuestra historia

A su salud bebiendo
(A su salud bebiendo)
Mientras me quede aliento
(Mientras me quede aliento)
Solo le estoy pidiendo
(Solo te estoy pidiendo)
Romper este silencio
(Romper este silencio)

Súbeme la radio que esta es mi canción
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tráeme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol

Súbeme la radio que esta es mi canción
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tráeme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol

Ando loco y desesperado en busca de tu amor
No me dejes en esta soledad, te pido
Nena te digo, vuelve conmigo
Si tú me llamas, te juro que pa' allá voy yo

Quiero verte ya, ya no aguanto más
Quiero darte calor solo una vez más
Ya no aguanto más, quiero verte ya, hoy

Yo no te miento
Todavía te espero
Sabes bien que te quiero
No sé vivir sin ti

Yo no te miento
Todavía te espero
Sabes bien que te quiero
No sé vivir sin ti

Súbeme la radio que esta es mi canción
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tráeme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol

Súbeme la radio que esta es mi canción

"Turn up the radio
Bri-bring me the alcohol
 
Turn up the radio that this is my song
Feel the bass that goes up

Today we gonna join the moon and the sun
 
Turn up the radio that this is my song
Feel the bass that goes up
Bring me the alcohol that takes away the pain
Today we gonna join the moon and the sun
 
I don't care anymore
Neither the day nor the hour
If I've lost everything
You left me in the shadows
 
I swear I think you
I make the best attempt
Time goes slow
And I'm gonna die
(And I'm gonna die)
 
If the night comes and you don't answer
I swear I keep waiting at your door
I live on sleepless nights
And I keep singing under the full moon
 
Turn up the radio that this is my song

Turn up the radio that this is my song

Bring me the alcohol that takes away the pain
Today we gonna join the moon and the sun
 
Fleeing the past
Every morning
I can't find any way
To erase our history
To your health by drinking
(To your health by drinking)
As long as I breathe
(As long as I breathe)
I'm just asking you
(I'm just asking you)
Break this silence
(Break this silence)
 
Turn up the radio that this is my song

Today we gonna join the moon and the sun
 
Turn up the radio that this is my song
Feel the bass that goes up
Bring me the alcohol that takes away the pain
Today we gonna join the moon and the sun
 
I'm crazy and desperate in search of your love
Don't leave me in this loneliness I beg you
I really tell you, go back with me
If you call me, I swear we dance
 
And I want to see you now
I can't stand it any more
I want to give you heat
Just one more time
I can't stand it any more
I want to see you now, ohhh
 
I don't lie to you
I still wait for you
You know I love you
I don't know how to live without you
 
I don't lie to you
I still wait for you
You know I love you
I don't know how to live without you

"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon",2020-09-08T01:18:49Z,2

I am 30 now and that good place is now long gone, but in times like these I find myself going back to songs like this to remind myself there is still hope.

They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, ""Congratulations"" (Uh, uh, uh)
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation (Uh-huh)
They ain't never had the dedication (Uh, uh)
People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it (Uh, uh)
Yeah, we made it (Uh, uh, uh)

And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
But I know I had to have it, yeah
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I be itching like a addict, yeah
I'm surrounded, twenty bad bitches, yeah
But they didn't know me last year, yeah
Everyone wanna act like they important (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dough, yuh (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Everyone countin' on me, drop the ball, yuh (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Everything custom like I'm at the border, yeah, yeah
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky
How could I make cents when I got millions on my mind?
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes

I was patient (Yeah, oh)
I was patient (Ayy, ooh)
Now I can scream that we made it (We made it!)
Now everywhere, everywhere I go, they say 'gratulation (Ooh)
Young nigga, young nigga, graduation (Yeah)
I pick up the rock and I ball, baby (Ball)
I'm looking for someone to call, baby (Brr)
But right now, I got a situation (Ayy)
Never old Ben-Ben Franklins (Cash)

My life is like a ball game (Ball game)
But instead, I'm in the trap though (Trap though)
Pot so big, call it Super Bowl (Super Bowl)
Super Bowl, call the hoes (Brr), get in the Rolls (Skrrt)
Top-floor lifestyle (Top), Huncho and Post (Yeah, ayy)
Malone (Ayy), I gotta play on my phone (Ayy)
You know what I'm on (Ayy), Huncho Houdini is gone (Ayy)
Chorus: Post Malone & Quavo]
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, ""Congratulations"" (Ayy, uh, uh, uh)
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation (Uh-huh, ooh)
They ain't never had the dedication (Ayy, uh, uh)
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it (Yeah, uh, uh)
Yeah, we made it (Ayy)

"Baby
Chris Jeday (Chris Jeday)
Austin baby
J Balvin man
Ozuna baby, (Ozuna)

No quiere saber na' de mí
Ay, dime qué fue lo que yo hice mal
Te pusieron en contra de mí
Al que fue, no se lo voy a perdonar

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue
Yo si me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos (Let go, come on)

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos

Sé que te pasas negando, todo lo que tú y yo hacíamos
Queda en tu mente grabado todas las veces que nos desvestíamos
Ahora me paso pensando, cómo tú puedes vivir así
Diciendo que no sabes lo que entre sábanas tú te entregaba a mí

Solo yo, he podido llegarle
Tu cuerpo sabe elevarse
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban
No decía nada ya no

Dialogando con el dinero
No quiero interrupciones
Esa es la prioridad
Pasaste lista de opciones
Estoy con la colombiana, que sepa mañana y la cubana llega a Paris
Llámate al ruso, que baje los kilos de oro que llegan a la calle de Brasil

Solo yo he podido llegarle
Tu cuerpo sabe, elevarse
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban
No decía nada, nada no no

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos

Y ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no
Y si me ha visto se supone, que en el pasado fue
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo, hacíamos
Cuando en la cama nos matábamos (J Balvin man)

Por más que me niegues a mí, no puedes escaparte
Si era tu luz de mi sombra y me seguías a todas partes
Nos lograron separar, tú no quisiste escuchar
Fue más importante qué dijo la gente, que a dónde podíamos llegar

En el mundo de mí están hablando
Diciendo mil cosas
Que me ven por aquí, que me ven por allá
Por mi vida famosa
Tú me conoces de años atrás, sabes cómo es la cosa
Tú sabes que yo soy real
Te lo dije una vez

Y sé que nuestro amor es periódico de ayer
Que tú no lo quieres leer, que ni por la calle tú me quieres ver
Si sales de party me escuchas a mí, siempre te preguntan por mí baby
Dime qué se siente ser el fantasma que te atormenta a ti

Dime que pasó mami, todo iba normal
Te hablaron de mí, te dejastes llevar
Tu cuerpo me estaba empezando a amar
Y por culpa de la gente, ahora te toca olvidar

Yo sé que eres infeliz, pero te pasas mintiendo
Fingiendo que eres feliz, mami yo no te entiendo
Ahora él te pone a llorar, también te pone a sufrir
Mientras yo te ponía a viajar, yo linda te hacía lucir

Solo yo he podido llegarle
Tu cuerpo sabe elevarse
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban
No me decía nada nada no no

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos

Y ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos

Ozuna

Things you never say to me, oh, oh

Just a little bit's enough

Just give me a reason

Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

You're still written in the scars on my heart
You're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh, tear ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust
But our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent

Sam Smith goes down in history as the most popular male vocalist of the '010s decade... I'd be honored if some Sam Smith fans who appreciate 80s/90s classics would take a listen to my acoustic piano & vocal YT performances of PURPLE RAIN by Prince and PRAYING FOR TIME by George Michael in tribute to 2 of the greatest vocalist-songwriters of all time.

"French lyrics :
Tu dois penser que je suis stupide
Tu dois penser que je suis un imbécile
Tu dois penser que je suis novice en la matière
Mais j'ai déjà connu ça auparavant


Je ne te laisserai jamais te rapprocher de moi
Même si tu comptes le plus pour moi
Parce que chaque fois que je m'ouvre, je souffre
Alors, je ne deviendrai jamais trop proche de toi
Même quand je compte le plus pour toi
Au cas où tu partirais en me laissant seule dans ma boue

Je pleure moins chaque fois que tu me blesses
Mes larmes sèchent plus vite chaque fois que tu me laisses
Et je t'aime de moins chaque fois que tu me quittes
Bébé, nous n'avons aucune chance ; c'est vrai et c'est triste

Je suis bien trop doué pour les adieux
(Je suis bien trop doué pour les adieux)


Je suis bien trop doué pour les adieux
(Je suis bien trop doué pour les adieux)

Je sais que tu penses que je suis cruel
Je sais que tu crois que je suis froid
Je protège juste mon innocence
Je protège simplement mon âme

Je ne te laisserai jamais te rapprocher de moi
Même si tu comptes le plus pour moi
Parce que chaque fois que je m'ouvre, je souffre
Alors, je ne deviendrai jamais trop proche de toi
Même quand je compte le plus pour toi
Au cas où tu partirais en me laissant seule dans ma boue

Je pleure moins chaque fois que tu me blesses
Mes larmes sèchent plus vite chaque fois que tu me laisses


Et je t'aime moins chaque fois que tu me quittes
Bébé, nous n'avons aucune chance ; c'est vrai et c'est triste

Je suis bien trop doué pour les adieux
(Je suis bien trop doué pour les adieux)
Je suis bien trop doué pour les adieux
(Je suis bien trop doué pour les adieux)

Hors de question que tu me voies pleurer
(Hors de question que tu me voies pleurer)
Hors de question que tu me voies pleurer
(Hors de question que tu me voies pleurer)
Non
Non, non, non, non, non
(Je suis bien trop doué pour les adieux)
Non, non, non, non
Non, non, non


(Je suis bien trop doué pour les adieux)
(Hors de question que tu me voies pleurer)

Car je pleure moins chaque fois que tu me blesses
Mes larmes sèchent plus vite chaque fois que tu me laisses
Et je t'aime moins chaque fois que tu me quittes
Bébé, nous n'avons aucune chance ; c'est vrai et c'est triste

"BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY SONGTEXT

Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landside
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see

I'm just a poor boy (Poor boy)
I need no sympathy
Because Im easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Any way the wind blows
Doesnt really matter to me
To me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away


Mama, ooh, ooh, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If Im not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
As if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave it all behind and face the truth

Mama, ooh, ooh, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, Scaramouch will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
Galileo (Galileo) Galileo (Galileo)
Galileo, Figaro (Magnifico)

I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah, no, we will not let you go (Let him go)
Bismillah, we will not let you go (Let him go)
Bismillah, we will not let you go (Let me go)
Will not let you go (Let me go)
Will not let you go, let me go
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia
Mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside
For me, for me, for me

So you think you can stop me and spit my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here

Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Any way the wind blows",2020-09-05T20:19:51Z,20

"1:41 - They will take whatever comes at them , i have seen dpgs tossing away war of which such a large crowd does NOTHING that had it been responded to in the same coin would have not been half the story but they stall , do not take too long , take the whole time . The diference between a dog and snake talking is when 1 starts never stops , no pause , no inbetween , no nothing , it is just bark , no inner capacity to realize and snakes is more like they only interrupt , do not have much to say or always the same but when some1 says anything they just topple over on the same moment . They have no build up , from it is the only way to uproot game . They speak of patience for when stealthing around but it is much about the on going action instead where comprehension is formulated like the 1st video , 1 understands the situation , probably the last thing they do . It is neither and defence too aids on nothing . It is only preventive . 1 makes whatever was those timestamps that still may not always be at 1 ' s favour , as such is seen in wrestling talking of build ups or lost title matches according to falls and then is actually who comes back for another match . Fully depleted is kind of OP , it only brings both ends closer to each other , most do die or did by the sword within it where such a clatter is catched and not kept up with , not nessecarly any deadly blow or defended from at 1st .",2020-09-06T08:23:21Z,2

Vestido, de traje, lujuria salvaje bajo mi piel
Si dios, puso la manzana fue para morder
Ay dios, pequemo' abrazaditos hasta el amanecer

Llego la fiesta, pa' tu boquita
Toda la noche, todito el dia
Vamo' a bañarnos en la orillita
Que la marea esta picadita-ita-ita

Una mordidita, una mordidita, una mordidita
De tu boquita
Una mordidita, una mordidita, una mordidita

Tus labios, mis dientes
Bocado crujiente, rico pastel
Fuego en tus pupilas, tu cuerpo destila tequila y miel

Me parece natural, letal, así te pones a bailar
No te pones freno cuando te pones a sudar
Vamo' a lo low, para sentir tu flow
Pa enseñarte niña, pa llamar la atención
Te mantiene en tensión, sin bajar la presión
El sudor tiene cura pa frenar la tensión

Deja de moderte, estoy vampiro bien demente
Deja de moderte, te lo juro y si la gente
Deja de moderte, bien despacito y búscame
Deja de moderte, amarradito bien demente

"Lyrics🎧

You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make-up to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful
So co-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why, you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eye-eye-eyes
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful

Na na na na na na

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
(You don't know, oh oh)
You don't know you're beautiful
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh

"Letra

You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make-up to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough

Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful

So co-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why, you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eye-eye-eyes
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful

Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
(You don't know, oh oh)
You don't know you're beautiful

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful",2020-09-08T19:00:02Z,1

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Needless to say, I keep in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (Yeah)
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (Wreck)
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (Wreck)
Needless to say, I'm keeping in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're a sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower

Every time I'm leavin' on ya (Ooh)
You don't make it easy, no (No, no)
Wish I could be there for ya (Ooh)
Give me a reason to, oh (Oh)
Every time I'm walkin' out (Oh)
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around (Oh, oh)
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down (No)
Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (Now)
I know you're scared of the unknown (Known)
You don't wanna be alone (Alone)
I know I always come and go (And go)
But it's out of my control

[Chorus: Post Malone]
And you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya

"This song really means something to me. I listen to a lot of music, as im sure everyone else does too. But nothing is quite like this one. It connects all of my best memories and every time I listen to it, I revisit them. My grandma, my sister, my girlfriend, my best friends, Spider-Man, all the good stuff. Obviously you don't know me, but reading the comments, its awesome to see this song has a similar effect on other people. I remember one time I was in a bit of an argument with my S.O and it was a big one, which does not happen often. I was driving her home, and this song came over my Playlist. By the time I drove in the lane way, and the song had faded out, we were both teared up, and we just hugged for like 20 minutes. I dont even remember what the argument was, but if a song can have that kind of positive effect on people, then whomever created it did so with unbelievable passion, positivity and creativity.

Your face isn’t a mask, don’t hide it.
Your body isn’t a book, don’t judge it.
Your heart isn’t a door, don’t lock it.
Your life isn’t a movie, don’t end it.

You are you, and you’re beautiful the way you are.  There are at least 2 people in this world that would sacrifice themselves for your living. 

Be proud of yourself, be you. Express your feeling and show that you are great, because you certainly are. 

Study hard, push yourself, and you will achieve your goals. Keep fit, eat healthy and keep hygiene. We can get through COVID-19 together!

"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told you
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some
Breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars
For that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you 'til
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

"My best friend is battling cancer and before 1 year she had anorexia 
I love her so much 
she is my best friend
Edit:She died yesterday 
She listened this song and then after 1 hour she died 
Edit:This is a real story 
I told her to listen this song  and she did 
Then I had to go to my house 
I was called by the hospital and I ran there 
When I got there they told me she died 
It's really hard to think about it 
So respect that please 
I'm not begging for likes 
I never said that I want likes 
I just wanted to share my story 
Thank you for reading this!  Be healthy,have a good day and a life and be strong 
Edit:Everyday i go to her grave and I say our ""best friends code"" 
Our code was:""Forever together and stronger than ever""
Be strong guys 
You can go through everything 
😊
Edit:I just want to remind you guys that you have to stay strong 
 Even if something bad happens just keep your head up 
I saw my best friend in my dreams yesterday 
When I saw her I remembered that I need to stay strong through everything like she did
Maybe she didn't make it through her battle with cancer but she was strong 
So stay strong with your head up 
You can do it 
I know that😊
Just remember that when something is wrong ",2017-07-23T11:20:20Z,19357

"There was a blind girl who hated herself just because she was blind. She hated everyone, except her loving boyfriend. He was always there for her. She said that if she could only see the world, she would marry her boyfriend.

One day, someone donated a pair of eyes to her and then she could see everything, including her boyfriend. Her boyfriend asked her, “Now that you can see the world, will you marry me?”

The girl was shocked when she saw that her boyfriend was blind too, and refused to marry him. Her boyfriend walked away in tears, and later wrote a letter to her saying: “Just take care of my eyes dear.”

"The greatest man in history is Jesus.
He had no servants, yet they called him master. He had no degree, yet they called him teacher. He had no medicines, yet they called him healer.He had no army, yet kings feared him.He won no military battles, yet he conquered the world.He committed no crime, yet they crucified him.He was buried in a tomb, Yet He lives Today.

Amen.

Btw isn’t it weird how Justin was accused of ****. The fact that the truth is coming out people be trying to put dirt on his name. Isn’t that weird ? just like many other artists who tried exposing the truth of hollyw00d.

"I need you the...
I need you, I need you the...
I need you the most

I gave you the key when the door wasn't open
Just admit it
See, I gave you faith
Turned your doubt into hoping
Can't deny it
Now I'm all alone
And my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you?

Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need you?
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down I didn't leave you
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?

Where are you now that I need you?
(bis)

I gave you attention when nobody else was paying
I gave you the shirt off my back
-What you saying?-
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playing
That's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying
Oh Lord

Where are you now that I need you?
I need you...
I need you the most

"I couldn’t believe what I was seeing !! It’s an incredible revelation a massive cry for help !! Do not shrug this off as conspiracy theory I think Justin Bieber is in Extreme Trouble and is a Slave to the very dark reality of Hollywood! 

The dark truth about Hollywood is hidden in plain sight on purpose and deliberately being put in a conspiracy theorist box so that we can look ridiculous if we mention it but the story laid out in this video which you can only catch in very slow motion is extreme and full of really strong claims !! 

I’ve watched the ridiculous long witted extra far out Illuminati , Area 51, reptilian shape shifters garbage which I’m certain is intentionally extra ridiculous to put every real thing in this same box of ridiculous because if you talk about some of it you talk about all of it and now you are that guy but this is not that !! This video is incredibly disturbing !! I’m actually in full prayer mode after watching this with the knowledge we all have now with people like Jeffrey Epstein Harvey Weinstein etc.. this stuff is not a joke !",2020-08-20T02:36:35Z,44

"Reasons you should stay

1. We would miss you. 
2. It's not worth the regret. Either by yourself if you failed or just simply left scars, or the regret everyone else feels by not doing enough to help you. 
3. It does get better. Believe it or not it will eventually get better. Sometimes you have to go through the storm to get to the rainbow. 
4. There's so much you would miss out on doing. 
5. There is always a reason to live. It might not be clear right now, but it is always there. 
6. So many people care, and it would hurt them if you hurt yourself. 
7. You ARE worth it. Don't let anyone, especially yourself, tell you otherwise. 
8. You are amazing. 
9. A time will come, once you've battled the toughest times of your life and are in ease once again, where you will be so glad that you decided to keep on living. You will emerge stronger from this all, and won't regret your choice to carry on with life. Because things always get better. 
10. What about all the things you've always wanted to do? What about the things you've planned, but never got around to doing? You can't do them when you're dead. 
11. I love you. Even if only one person loves you, that's still a reason to stay alive. 
12. You won't be able to listen to music if you die.

"I'm only human
I'm only, I'm only
I'm only human, human

Maybe I'm foolish
Maybe I'm blind
Thinking I can see through this
And see what's behind
Got no way to prove it
So maybe I'm blind
But I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

Take a look in the mirror
And what do you see
Do you see it clearer
Or are you deceived
In what you believe
'Cause I'm only human after all
You're only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

Some people got the real problems
Some people out of luck
Some people think I can solve them
Lord heavens above
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

Don't ask my opinion
Don't ask me to lie
Then beg for forgiveness
For making you cry
Making you cry
'Cause I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

Oh, some people got the real problems
Some people out of luck
Some people think I can solve them
Lord heavens above
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

I'm only human
I make mistakes
I'm only human
That's all it takes
To put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

I'm no prophet or Messiah
Should go looking somewhere higher
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

I'm only human
I do what I can
I'm just a man
I do what I can
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me",2020-09-06T12:17:01Z,16

"Просто оставлю это тут)
Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind

Возможно, я глуп или слеп,

Thinking I can see through this and see what's behind

Если решил, что могу видеть всех и вся насквозь.

Got no way to prove it so maybe I'm blind

У меня нет доказательств своей правоты, так что возможно, я ослеп.



But I'm only human after all

Но, в конце концов, я всего лишь человек,

I'm only human after all

В конце концов, я всего лишь человек,

Don't put your blame on me

Не вини меня.


Take a look in the mirror and what do you see

Взгляни в зеркало. Что ты видишь?

Do you see it clearer or are you deceived

Для тебя что-то прояснилось? Или же ты чувствуешь, что обманулся

In what you believe

В том, во что верил?


Cos I'm only human after all

Ведь, в конце концов, я всего лишь человек,

You're only human after all

И ты, в конце концов, всего лишь человек,

Don't put the blame on me

Не вини меня,

Don't put your blame on me

Не вини меня.



Some people got the real problems

Есть люди, проходящие через испытания,

Some people out of luck

Есть люди, от которых отвернулась удача,

Some people think I can solve them

Есть люди, которые думают, что я могу разрешить их проблемы,

Lord heavens above

О, великие небеса!

I'm only human after all

В конце концов, я просто человек,

I'm only human after all

В конце концов, я просто человек,

Don't put the blame on me

Не вините меня,

Don't put the blame on me

Не вините меня.



Don't ask my opinion, don't ask me to lie

Не просите меня рассудить вас, не заставляйте лгать,

Then beg for forgiveness for making you cry, for making you cry

А потом просить прощения за ваши слёзы, за ваши слёзы.



Cos I'm only human after all

Ведь, в конце концов, я всего лишь человек,

I'm only human after all

В конце концов, я всего лишь человек,

Don't put your blame on me

Не вините меня,

Don't put the blame on me

Не вините меня.



Some people got the real problems

Lord heavens above

О, великие небеса!

I'm only human after all

В конце концов, я просто человек,

I'm only human after all

В конце концов, я просто человек,

Don't put the blame on me

Не вините меня,

Don't put the blame on me

Не вините меня.



I'm only human I make mistakes

Я всего лишь человек, я совершаю ошибки.

I'm only human that's all it takes

Я всего лишь человек, и потому так просто

To put the blame on me

Винить меня.

Don't put your blame on me

Не вини меня.



I'm no prophet or messiah

Я не пророк, я не мессия,

Should go looking somewhere higher

Вам стоит поискать где-нибудь повыше.



I'm only human after all

В конце концов, я просто человек,

I'm only human after all

В конце концов, я просто человек,

Don't put the blame on me

Не вините меня,

Don't put the blame on me

Не вините меня.



I'm only human, I do what I can

Я просто человек, я делаю то, что в моих силах,

I'm just a man, I do what I can

Я всего лишь человек, я делаю то, что в моих силах,

Don't put the blame on me

Не вините меня,

Anyway, we're all only human, yes, but where we all fail is to catch ourselves -- to think rationally -- before we act.  It's an eternal battle that humankind has to balance the emotional lobe with the rational one.  It would be so much easier if we only had logical, rational, unemotional minds like Spock.

"It's not good enough for me
Since I been with you, ooh
It's not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me, I know

I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Ooh, was she tipsy?
I had enough convo for 24
I peeped you from across the room
A pretty little body, dancing like GoGo, aye

And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Oooh, why not?
A fucking good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl then I'm so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage

Oh, oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

Feelin' like I'm fresh out, Boosie
If they want the drama, got the Uzi
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship
Doin' shit you don't even see in movies
Ride with me, ride with me, boss
I got a hard head but her ass soft
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million cash, told her plank on it

And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose?
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi

It's not good enough for me
Since I been with you, ooh

I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Ooh, was she tipsy?
I had enough convo for 24
I peeped you from across the room
A pretty little body, dancing like GoGo, aye

And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Oooh, why not?

Oh, oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

Oh, oh, you ain't enough for me
Too much for you alone
Baby, go and grab some bad bitches
Bring 'em home
Know the jet's on me
I'mma curve my best for you, you know
So pick up that dress for me
Leave the rest home

Too much combo 24 hours
When you stand next to 24 karats
She left her man at home
She don't love him no more
I want your mind and your body
Don't mind nobody
So as long you don't never hurt nobody
Baby girl, work your body, work your body

And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose? (Oooh)
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi (Why not?)

Oh, oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody

"She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry
Whoa, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
Whoa, oh, oh

LYRICSSSS
La la la la la
I dare you!
All of my life, too late
To you showed out with perfect timing
Now, here we are, you rock it
Our fingers are stuck in the socket
It's just a mature, a game
Get ready, we'll do it again
Let's not recover from the hangover
When your eyes got me drunk I was sober
Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare on the dance floor
La la la la la
Truth or dare on the dance floor
La la la la la oh, oh, oh, oh
I dare you
Of all the millions, on the planet
You're the one is keeping me on it
You know I like you, and nobody's business
And your are my witness
It's just a mature, a game
Get ready, we'll do it again
Let's not recover from the hangover
When your eyes got me drunk I was sober
Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare on the dance floor
La la la la la
Truth or dare on the dance floor
La la la la la oh, oh, oh, oh
I dare you
Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
I dare you to touch me
It's truth or dare on the dance floor

Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, okay?
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life… and repeat :D",2020-09-08T15:28:51Z,2

"LYRICS
And another one bites the dust
But why can I not conquer love?
And I might've thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I want it and I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah let's be clear, I trust no one
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace
Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah I may snap and I move fast
You won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart
And I will stay up through the night
Yeah let's be clear, I won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I walked through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
And I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace
Oh, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah I may snap and I move fast
You won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
Oh, and I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah I may snap and I move fast
You won't see me fall apart
No, 'cause I've got an elastic heart

My bf has a high conflict ex who uses their daughter against him. He’s always fighting for his daughter. The cage is what he’s trapped in trying to coparent with his ex, to get to his daughter. He just wants to love her. 
My BF cries to this video every time. So do I. Get to see what it’s like to deal with this in his head vicariously through this video. 

Please don’t sexualize something just because you don’t understand how artists’ create their art. This video was not made for that. It was made for healing, in my opinion.",2020-08-19T13:07:01Z,158

1. The guy represents sia herself and Maddie plays as sia's bipolar disorder. This one makes sense the most if u think about it.

2.the guy is the alcoholic father and maddie is his daughter who's trying to escape him.

3. I remember hearing maddie explaining it saying that she represents a wolf and the guy is the tamer, I heard this so long ago so correct me if I'm wrong.",2020-08-20T22:53:46Z,77

As she matures she realizes she doesnt have to continue that cycle of thinking and in turn is able to ""escape"" that cage. When she re-enters that cage it's because she wants to show.. perhaps her father whom she grew up with, that there was a way out of that cycle of pain and line of thinking but he is too old and stuck in his ways to be able to escape even though he recognizes he wants to.. super relatable to my life lol.",2020-09-07T16:47:58Z,0

"I know little of contemporary dance. I do know that focusing on the dance, the movements themselves are the goal. If you can, forget the difference in age or the fact one was male and one female. Dismiss that they are even human (the dance mimics animal behavior). I saw one ""being""  (shia) longing for connection, friendship, love... acceptance. The whole time, trying to win the others trust. The other ""being"" (maddie) a wounded soul who knows pain, is mistrustful, hesitant and fiercely defensive in her movements for most of the dance. I saw nothing sexual in the dance or movements. There was no lust conveyed to these eyes. At the end he had finally won her trust and she sees him for what he is...a friend, an ally. But the cage (society perhaps) will never allow them to be together and hence...the tragic ending. Fear of being alone drives most of us. I'm sure a large segment of the population can relate to this. It was beautiful.",2020-09-07T02:42:10Z,1

This song and “Clover Cage - On My Mind” are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together,2020-09-09T00:10:14Z,1

"This song reminds me of my dad and I always end up tearing up. I always thought of this video as a single dad raising his daughter and all the struggles that a parent has to go through to raise a child on their own. And then in the end the child grows up and moves on with their life (sia out of the cage), but somehow we still miss our parents and wish we could be with them (sia trying to pull Shia out of the cage), but we know that it will never be that away again.",2020-09-04T06:40:27Z,13

I was married to an alcoholic for 10 years.  I loved him and hated him at the same time.  I still love him.  And finally I had to get out of that cage.  He wouldn’t.  This video... I felt this for ten years.,2019-07-23T15:47:31Z,7994
"And another one bites the dust
But why can I not conquer love?
And I might've thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I want it and I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah let's be clear, I trust no one

You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah I may snap and I move fast
You won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

And I will stay up through the night
Yeah let's be clear, I won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I walked through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
And I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one

You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

Oh, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah I may snap and I move fast
You won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

Oh, and I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah I may snap and I move fast
You won't see me fall apart
No, 'cause I've got an elastic heart

And I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard

You won't see me fall apart

Shia climbed that cage like it was nothing. Insane.,2020-08-24T08:54:52Z,29
"Completely ignoring the meaning of the song and imagery and their dance- I love the absolute control that Shia had regarding Maddie. Like there wasn't a moment where I felt like Shia wasn't being absolutely careful with how much strength he put into interacting with Maddie, or felt like he would hurt her. That man knows his strength and how far to go, and Maddie trusts him to know that limit. I really like that.",2020-09-07T19:01:26Z,0
My love of my life passed away due to the fight with mental illness. I watch this video often and understand better the fight she had. This was a favorite video of hers..... Sometimes with her illness she felt trapped in a young body.... This song and video brings tears and remembrance each time,2020-08-19T22:57:49Z,2
"this whole song is about sia and her abusive father. the video makes perfect sense, just  no one understands 🤷🏻‍♀️",2020-09-08T16:44:56Z,0
If people weren’t so sick minded and stopped sexualising everything they’d see the absolute beauty in this video. I cant believe Sia had so much criticism from this. It’s a true work of art and it shook me to my core,2020-06-03T23:48:29Z,4611
"Finally she's tamed, she loves, but he's trapped and she can't save him",2020-08-28T02:09:14Z,48
"My interpretation :

Basically this video is kind of based on flexibility and elasticity of a woman hearts as compared to men's heart which is basically caged in ego , domination , stiffness , toughness etc etc...
He do wanna come out but that brain that controlling brain being so stiff doesn't allow him..

Basically this video kind of compares elasticity of heart between the two sex in the society",2020-09-07T14:11:04Z,0

"He thinks she needs him, but in the end finds he needs her. It reminds me of intimacy... kind of like a traumatized animal that you adopt: Both parties want to be close to the other but they are both scared, and inevitably, inadvertently trigger one another each time they attempt to get close. It is a struggle... a back and fourth. But in the end, it seems she feels safe with him. She shows him the way out, and they both want him to come with her,  but he cant escape his own prison. Beautiful...",2020-08-29T02:28:32Z,12
"Absolutely amazing from @SiaVEVO, Maddie Ziegler and Shia LaBeouf! ",2015-01-07T17:17:43Z,2201
The whole video was extraordinary representing emotional pain from both of them and then at 4:20s that had to be the saddest heart felt hit I’ve ever experienced in a music video. A daughter trying to save her father from whatever the anguish and escape needed is shown in Shia LeBeouf character’s facial expression. WOW!,2020-08-25T20:58:51Z,10

"The fact that people associate this with pedophilia or sexuality in general shows how twisted the internet has become. How can you even look at this an think of something sexual? I feel like something might be wrong with you if you can look at this and see anything sexual about it. People can share an intimate relationship without it being sexual, in this case it is the intimacy between father and daughter.",2020-03-03T12:35:30Z,2756

It's a pretty grim tell of our modern world where the relationship between a father and daughter is just automatically interpretted as devious. This is the same society where men are faced with criminal action for helping a lost child who asks for help.,2020-09-08T02:06:33Z,0

Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name la-la-la

We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila Sunrise

But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh I should be running
Ooh you keep me coming

Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say, ""We're just friends.""
But friends don't know the way you taste-la-la-la
'Cause you know it's been a long time comin'
Don't you let me fall, oh

Oh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop

I love it when you call me Señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh I should be running
Ooh you know I love it

When you call me Señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la

Ooh I should be running
Ooh you keep me coming
For ya

All along I'll be coming for ya (for ya)
And I hope it meant something to ya

Comin' for ya (comin' for ya)

"Señorita LYRICS :
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la, yeah

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la la la
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't you let me fall, oh
Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
All along I've been coming for ya
And I hope it meant something to ya
Call my name, I'll be coming for ya
Coming for ya, coming for ya, coming for ya
For ya (oh, she loves it when I come)
For ya
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

"[Intro]
""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings.""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance."" (Six minutes— Six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it."" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances.""
""You are just what the doc ordered.""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?",2020-05-09T09:03:54Z,592

"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's goin' off about somethin' that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
""Hey, isn't this easy?""
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what you doin' with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers

Standin' by and waitin' at your back door

You belong with me
You belong with me

Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?

"Adventure Of A Lifetime - Lyrics

turn your magic on
Umi she’d say
everything you want’s a dream away
and we are legends every day
that’s what she told me

turn your magic on,
to me she’d say
everything you want’s a dream away
under this pressure under this weight
we are diamonds

now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
and I feel my heart beating
oh you make me feel
like I’m alive again
alive again
oh you make me feel
like I’m alive again

said I can’t go on, not in this way
I’m a dream that died by light of day
gonna hold up half the sky and say
only I own me
and I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
oh I can feel my heart beating
cause you make me feel
like I’m alive again
alive again
oh you make me feel
like I’m alive again

turn your magic on, Umi she’d say
everything you want’s a dream away
under this pressure under this weight
we are diamonds taking shape
we are diamonds taking shape

if we’ve only got this life
this adventure oh then I
and if we’ve only got this life
you get me through
and if we’ve only got this life
in this adventure oh then I
want to share it with you
with you
with you
yeah I do
woohoo
woohoo
woohoo

I can still remember the synthesizer that was keeping her up all night, waking me up half in half an hour until 3 to 8 A.M. every morning. :D She was... 67 - because she never had the pleasure to celebrate her 68th birthday on 4 May 2019... she died in the silent night on 4th January 2019, and yes, I know this is late to say, but with all this quarantine thing, I found the occasion to share this memory of her and my life with you.

"honestly miley was ahead of her time, she was naked to show weakness and purity. It was art, not sexualization. But yall are to focused on sexualizing the female body that her career fell because of how disgusting society was during this time. If you still find nudity revolting and sexual then shame on you. Being nude used to be art and beauty, purity and weakness. The same people who are like ""ew everythings so sexual and gross now theres so much skin being shown"" are the same people who are like ""I wish it were like the old days where no one showed skin."" but news flash; back then there was more nudity than ever, but the human body wasbt sexualized. There were naked statued everywhere. So YOURE the problem, YOURE the one sexualizing the human body, YOURE the ones shutting down art. Shame on you.",2020-08-23T17:51:26Z,564

Being naked she is trying to potray a symbol of purity, an untained person who is madly in love but is hurt tremendously and remains unaccepted by the person she loves.

"i will always despise people who hated Miley back then. who just couldn’t stop saying the most awful things about her and her music just because she was herself and not fake. i admired her since 2011 when i was 15 and never stopped till this day. yeah, of course i was shocked by some things she’s done, but it never overshadowed her beautiful heart and soul for me. she’s always been so caring and thoughtful — from her love to animals to such a big love for her partner for so many years. not mentioning her amazing Happy Hippie Foundation. and her voice... oh god, her voice — you’ll never find anyone with such unique timbre and the way only she can sing with all her soul.

she always was and is the most open-minded artist of our generation but she had to take so much shit from millions of terribly close-minded haters.

now it’s just ridiculous to see so many comments like “wow, i used to hate her so much but now it’s normal so she’s the queen. yay. nostaaalgia” well, good for you. at least NOW you’re finally at the level where you can appreciate her as she deserves it.",2020-08-24T07:13:46Z,37

Bad Bunny, baby, bebé
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh
Yeah
Todos están pendiente a ti (wouh)
Pero tú puesta pa' mí (ajá)
Haciendo que me odien más (yeh-yeh-yeh)

Porque todos te quieren probar (ah)
Lo que no saben es que no te dejas llevar de cualquiera
Y todos te quieren probar (nah)
Lo que no saben es que hoy yo te voy a buscar (yeh-yeh)

Dile que tú eres mía, mía
Tú sabes que eres mía, mía
Tú misma lo decías
Cuando yo te lo hacía
yeh, dile que tú eres mía, mía
Tú sabes que eres mía, mía
Tú misma lo decías
Cuando yo te lo hacía
Yeh yeh yeh yeh

Bebé, yo soy fan de tu caminar (¡wouh!)
Te doy todo lo mío, hasta mi respirar (yeh)
Contigo veo todo como en espiral (yeh)
Quiero tirarnos fotos y que se hagan viral (ja)
Tus ojos me concentran como Adderall (¡wouh!)
Contigo me sube el overall (yeh)
Te toco y hasta el mundo deja de girar
A nosotros ni la muerte nos va a separar (nah)
Bebé, yo soy tuyo na' más (na' más)
Diles que conmigo te vas (¡wouh!)
Que dejen de tirarte (prr)
Que a ti nadie va a tocarte

Dile que tú eres mía, mía
Tú sabes que eres mía, mía
Tú misma lo decías (tú misma lo decías)
Cuando yo te lo hacía (cuando yo te lo hacía)
yeh, dile que tú eres mía, mía
Tú sabes que eres mía, mía
Tú misma lo decías (tú misma lo decías)
Cuando yo te lo hacía (cuando yo te lo hacía)

Yo soy tu Romeo, pero no Santo (no)
A estos bobos con la forty los espanto (plo-plo)
Muchas me quieren desde que yo canto (jah)
Pero yo soy tuyo na' más (¡wouh!)
Yo soy tu Romeo, pero no Santo (yeh)
A estos bobos con la forty los espanto
Muchas me quieren desde que yo canto (ajá)
Pero yo soy tuyo na' más (¡buh!)
Dile que tú eres mía desde la high (desde la high, yeh)
El yerno favorito de tu mai (de tu mai)
El capo que tenía todas las Jordans y las Nike (y las Nike)
Dile a estos bobos que dejen de darte like (de darte like)
Quiero otra noche entera
Pa' recordar los tiempos en la escalera (escalera)
Dile que yo no soy cualquiera
Yo soy tu primero, tú eres mi primera, yah yah

Porque todos te quieren probar (ajá)
Lo que no saben es que no te dejas llevar de cualquiera (no no no no)
Y todos te quieren probar (¡wouh!)
Lo que no saben es que hoy yo te voy a buscar (yeh yeh, prr)

Dile que tú eres mía, mía
Tú sabes que eres mía, mía
Tú misma lo decías (tú misma lo decías)

Bad Bunny, baby, bebé
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh

Todos están pendiente a ti (wouh)
Pero tú puesta pa' mí (ajá)
Haciendo que me odien más (yeh-yeh-yeh)

Porque todos te quieren probar (ah)
Lo que no saben es que no te dejas llevar de cualquiera
Y todos te quieren probar (nah)
Lo que no saben es que hoy yo te voy a buscar (yeh-yeh)

Tú sabes que eres mía, mía
Tú misma lo decías
Cuando yo te lo hacía
Yeh yeh yeh yeh

Bebé, yo soy fan de tu caminar (¡wouh!)
Te doy todo lo mío, hasta mi respirar (yeh)
Contigo veo todo como en espiral (yeh)
Quiero tirarnos fotos y que se hagan viral (ja)
Tus ojos me concentran como Adderall (¡wouh!)
Contigo me sube el overall (yeh)
Te toco y hasta el mundo deja de girar
A nosotros ni la muerte nos va a separar (nah)
Bebé, yo soy tuyo na' más (na' más)
Diles que conmigo te vas (¡wouh!)
Que dejen de tirarte (prr)

Yo soy tu Romeo, pero no Santo (no)
A estos bobos con la forty los espanto (plo-plo)
Muchas me quieren desde que yo canto (jah)
Pero yo soy tuyo na' más (¡wouh!)
Yo soy tu Romeo, pero no Santo (yeh)
A estos bobos con la forty los espanto
Muchas me quieren desde que yo canto (ajá)
Pero yo soy tuyo na' más (¡buh!)
Dile que tú eres mía desde la high (desde la high, yeh)
El yerno favorito de tu mai (de tu mai)
El capo que tenía todas las Jordans y las Nike (y las Nike)
Dile a estos bobos que dejen de darte like (de darte like)
Quiero otra noche entera
Pa' recordar los tiempos en la escalera (escalera)
Dile que yo no soy cualquiera
Yo soy tu primero, tú eres mi primera, yah yah

Porque todos te quieren probar (ajá)
Lo que no saben es que no te dejas llevar de cualquiera (no no no no)
Y todos te quieren probar (¡wouh!)

Pero que clase de rumba pa pa
Pa la que yo cogí anoche que que que
No recuerdo lo que sucedió
Pero que clase de rumba pa pa
Pa la que yo cogí anoche que que que
No recuerdo lo que sucedió
Pero que hora son, qué fue lo que paso
Por qué Farru tiene el carro aparcado en la habitación
Yo no recuerdo, solo se que amaneció
Y que tenia un tatuaje que decía ""Peace & Love""
Pero que confusión, creo que cometí un error
Y mezcle los tragos y una pastillitas de color
Que sentimiento creo que tenia un medicamento
De esos que te noquean duro contra el pavimento
Ya son las 6 de la mañana
Y todavía no recuerdo nada
Ni siquiera conozco tu cara
Pero amaneciste aquí en mi cama
Ya son las 6 de la mañana
Y todavía no recuerdo nada
Ni siquiera conozco tu cara

No recuerdo lo que sucedió
Pero que clase de rumba pa pa
Pa la que yo cogí anoche que que que
No recuerdo lo que sucedió
Y ya no me acuerdo de nada, no tengo nada en la mente
Solo que estaba tomando mucho ron con aguardiente
Rumbiando en la disco estaba prendido el ambiente
Ese es mi único recuerdo hasta donde estuve consciente
Se acababa la botella y de camino ya venia
J.Balvin me estaba hablando y no sabia lo que decía
Creo que nos presentaron, aun no lo se todavía
Que no recuerdo tu nombre mala suerte la mía
Ya son las 6 de la mañana
Y todavía no recuerdo nada
Ni siquiera conozco tu cara
Pero amaneciste aquí en mi cama
Ya son las 6 de la mañana
Y todavía no recuerdo nada
Ni siquiera conozco tu cara
Pero amaneciste aquí en mi cama
Ya esta amaneciendo, el sol saliendo
Yo amanezco a lado tuyo, bebe (gal)

"If you want it, take it
I should have said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore

I only want to die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

You were better, deeper
I was under your spell
Like a deadly fever, yeah, babe
On the highway to hell

I only want to die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

Thought of your body, I came alive
It was lethal, it was fatal
In my dreams it felt so right
But I woke up every time
Oh baby

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free

"Wow, it came out one month after grandpa Grande’s death, so when she’s saying “I’m stronger than I’ve been before” it probably has a liaison with his speech that says “you have music, You gotta work on, don’t let them challenge you. Don’t let them intimidate you. “I love you” I love you too” SO maybe it isn’t a coincidence !!",2020-08-21T09:49:45Z,19

If you want it, take it
I should have said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore

I only want to die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free

"HALO LYRİCS

Remember those walls I built
Well, baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you win
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo

You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again

But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again
Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
The risk that I'm taking

I'm never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away


I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
Halo, halo
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away


I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo

"the AMAZING lyrics

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But, I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out!

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I'd be honored if some Beyonce fans who appreciate 80s/90s classics would take a listen to my acoustic piano & vocal YT performances of PURPLE RAIN by Prince and PRAYING FOR TIME by George Michael in tribute to 2 of the greatest vocalist-songwriters in music history. Live acoustic with no autotune. Peace and everybody stay safe in the '020s.",2020-08-29T16:25:41Z,170

"Lyrics:
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave will you hold my hand?

Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look, gain some self control
And deep down I know this never works
But you could lay with me so it doesn't hurt

Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh, won't you stay with me?

"My mom died from a selfinflicted gun shot wound to the brain she died instantly on October 25th 2015 i was only 9 years of age and i was in the house at the time she died. I remeber running doen stairs and seeing my mother lying on the floor in a puddle of blood, i remember me trying to push her on her back so i could hug her for the last time even though she died instantly... my clothes were covered in my mothers blood. But two minutes later my moms friends walks into the door and seeing me on the floor hugging my mother she called 911 immediately then she tryed to pick me up but i never let go of my mother the police  had to take me off of my mother and i just broke down in tears then i hugged the police officer 

I cant believe i went through this when i was only nine years old. My mom never had depression or any type of syptoms it was just a lethal action and now i have to live with that memory and i still have the clothes that were soaked in my mothers blood and i will never give them away or take a trillion dollars for it.

"After everyone's last breath on earth, the soul (spirit) goes to a new place; that's either Heaven or Hell. 
How is heaven? heaven is a very good place with no sins, sorrows, crying, lust, greed; in other words there is no sin there and it’s full of joy.

How is hell? Matthew 13:50 (UKJV) “And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” Hell is very terrible and it’s very very hot, you can’t survive placing your hand on a hot stove for 10 seconds, don’t even think you will withstand burning there without being consumed,
The thing here is you will be burned without being consumed in hell the same same way you boil a hard rock in water you will be there for eternity,
Again after judgement you will be thrown in lake of fire forever. 

Hell is a place of suffering from intense tormenting, so why choose to go there instead of going to Heaven? 

Here is the steps you must read, understand and believe in order to be sure you will be on your way to Heaven. 

Salvation
Jesus said, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me"" (John 14:6). He also said, ""I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved"" (John 10:9, NASB). Jesus is not only the way to heaven, he is also the door to heaven. 
Realise you are a sinner; Isaiah 64:6 (UKJV) But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses(the quality of being morally right) are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.

Deserving hell for sins
Realise that you deserve hell for your sins; 
Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever. 

Repent
So repent, Repenting means: to change your mind; a sincere turning away, in heart, mind and action; Therefore God wants you to repent of sinful values and of sinful living. God wants you to decide to follow Him and to make Jesus the Lord of your life.

No other way 
If you want to go to heaven, you've got to go through the door marked ""Jesus Christ."" There is no other entrance. 
By no other entrance it means belief in gods, Buddha, Muhammad or other beings or objects cannot save you; But only belief in Jesus Christ our Lord can save you.
No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus did for you as simple as that. Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Believe 
All you need to do is to truly believe with your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ suffered and got crucified and shed his blood for your sins at the cross, He was buried but rose again on the third day just to prove he was God and now alive in heaven. After that you will receive the holy spirit and you will know that you are going to heaven after death or when Jesus comes back while you are still alive.

After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c. 
As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life. Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag.",2020-09-08T14:42:06Z,0

"The sad thing about this song is its message is lost. This song was inspired by the death of young protestant childen in Britain who were murdered during the northern Ireland troubles. Although Dolores was Catholic Irish, she made this song in opposition to political aggression whether it's the Irish Republican forces, or the British Unionist forces. The point is there is only right and wrong, good and bad, both of which knows no sides. As an Irish man I pray that one day we all understand this message of unity (not as an island but as compassionate human beings for one another),  instead of the narcissistic exploitation of compassionate points wasted on social media. I don't care who officially owns land, we are all one and the same. RIP Dolores o'riordan",2020-08-10T01:43:27Z,8061

"Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence, caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head they are crying

Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme
Since nineteen-sixteen
In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dying

"This is a brilliant example of strong lyrics and despreate message for peace. The horrors and remanent trauma of this war, now that's a powerfull and moving theme for a mainstream song. 
I wish we had more of this in the actual pop/rock scene. There's still some bands writing deep and serious lyrics like that  of course, but politics seem to move more and more to the alternatives and more underground productions now.

"Hyäne - Russian translation
Эта песня о легенде из Боливии (страны Латинской Америки): ребенок глухой, отец плохо относился к нему, поэтому малыш убежал. Мальчик находит собаку и помогает старику (по легенде, его били хулиганы), затем они находят парня, который был в сатанинской группе, но он дезертировал и «el tío» (сатана в боливийской культуре) обезобразил его лицо, вот почему он в маске. Они идут в пещеру «el tio», и легенда гласит, что «el tio» воспевает все чувства ненависти и тому подобное, от этого люди развращаются и убивают друг друга. Тогда, старик и парень в маске прощаются с ребенком и уходят, чтобы не испортиться. И ребенок остается, но он не может развратиться, потому что глухой. Мальчик начинает исполнять мелодию ""el tio"", чтобы сохранять его спокойствие на всю вечность.

Я из Боливии, в городе, где это было снято, мне нравится это видео, и я хотел поделиться с вами легендой, извините, если у меня плохой английский, в меру своих возможностей :)

"Video Explanation :                                     
The music video is about a Bolivian 🇧🇴 legend that tells the story of a deaf boy who fled from his abusive home and found a stray dog 🐕 that accompanied him since then. After living on the streets. He discovers that he has the special ability of perceiving troubled people - which he can heal by screaming (screaming that its said to be as loud as an earthquake and a tornado🌪)

One day, he finds an old man who was being stoned by villagers while being taunted and ridiculed (hence why the old man has a dusty face) the boy intervened and by screaming, he resolved the situation and revived the old man’s heart (in the video, by buying him a new heart).

Old man and kid later meet a disfigured man who was abused, and was considered a leper by society (Called Kusillo in Bolivia). The disfigured man reveals that he is a prophet who was cursed by the devil 👹 (El Tio) because he didn’t worship him anymore and abandoned the town where the demon resided. 

👹 El Tio is considered the lord of the underworld, to whom mortal people offer gifts in exchange for protection, or to ease his anger. 

The prophet (masked man) said anybody who could hear the demon would fall under his control🌀. He told them that the demon could be found across a desert (Uyuni salt flats), where there was a town where people worshipped el tio 👹 - and the story said that el tio cursed the people in that town to kill themselves.

Together they start the journey to find the town, and arrive at a mine where the demon 👹 resided but they knew that everybody with their hearing intact could be cursed by el Tio👹 or be directed to kill each other. 

That is why boy had to face the demon  alone and over voice him with his scream to stop him from cursing others.(the ultimate sacrifice - and why the two man and the dog left- to avoid getting under el tio 👹 control 🌀)

The video has an open ending, considering that El Tio is the lord of the underworld who rules in the mines, and miners usually sacrifice a llama as a tribute from time to time to avoid being cursed. Sadly the boy could be seen as a big sacrifice to redeem the miners from El Tio’s undesirable influence.  
I’m Bolivian and love this story 🇧🇴

"LYRICS
Have you got color in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you (crawlin' back to you)
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few? (had a few)
'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy)
Busy bein' yours (bein' yours)
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
(Do I wanna know?) Too busy bein' yours to fall
(Sad to see you go) Ever thought of callin', darlin'?
(Do I wanna know?) Do you want me crawlin' back to you?",2020-08-25T17:23:59Z,581

"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
Wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter",2020-09-06T23:37:08Z,68

"""Cheerleader (Felix Jaehn Remix)""

[Verse 1:]
When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she stays strong
Yeah, yeah
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say

[Pre-chorus:]
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
I'm like no, not really 'cause

[Chorus:]
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Verse 2:]
She walks like a model
She grants my wishes
Like a genie in a bottle
Yeah, yeah
'Cause I'm the wizard of love
And I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say

[Pre-chorus:]
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
I'm like no, not really 'cause

[Chorus:]
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge:]
She gives me love and affection
Baby, did I mention
You're the only girl for me
No, I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too
She thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do
Is just for me to pop the question

[Chorus:]
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her",2020-08-20T15:48:08Z,78

"It’s the summer of 2016:

-Every thing was good

- Memes were about Trump and other things

- You got to watch the Olympics (Rip 2020 Olympics)

- Pokémon Go was the biggest app ever at the moment, and everyone was talking about it

- You hung out with your friends everyday, had sleepovers and rode your bikes everywhere and went over to your friends pools to go swimming.

- There were legendary songs being played right now (like this song).

- Life was a lot simpler back then, now your in High School doing countless hours of homework, studying for tests, and getting sleep deprived. 


I just wanna go back to these times where I was worried if I wasn’t going to see all of my friends over the weekend, and not if my grades are high enough to get into the colleges that I want to go to.

"I just want to stay in the sun where I find,
I know it’s hard sometimes,
Pieces of peace in the sun’s peace of mind,
I know it’s hard sometimes,
Yeah I think about the end just way too much,
But it’s fun to fantasize,
On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was,
But it’s fun to fantasize.

I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.

“I’d die for you,” that’s easy to say,
We have a list of people that we would take,
A bullet for them, a bullet for you,
A bullet for everybody in this room,
But I don’t seem to see many bullets coming through,
See many bullets coming through,
Metaphorically I’m the man,
But literally I don’t know what I’d do,
“I’d live for you” and that’s hard to do,
Even harder to say when you know it’s not true,
Even harder to write when you know that tonight,
There were people back home who tried talking to you,
But then you ignored them still,
All these questions they’re for real,
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.

I’ve been thinking too much,

"Lyrics
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
All my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize
Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride
I'd die for you
That's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them
A bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically I'm the man
But literally I don't know what I'd do
I'd live for you
And that's hard to do
Even harder to say
When you know it's not true
Even harder to write
When you know that tonight
There are people back home which are talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're forming like
Who would you live for?
Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?
Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
Help me
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much
Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time
Taking my time on my ride
Oh, oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my
I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)

"Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely""
Once I was seven years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely""
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream, like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old

(Lukas Graham!)

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once I was twenty years old

Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother, I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life, and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon I'll be sixty years old

Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon I'll be sixty years old

Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely""
Once I was seven years old

"Vamos cogele, ritmo, cintura, rodillas al piso
Baja y pasa el limbo
Vamos cogele, ritmo, cintura, rodillas al piso
Baja y pasa el limbo
Esto esta como, como pa, como pa', como pa' rumbiar
Pa' pasarla caliente, con toda mi gente
Nos favorece el sol, un bronceado y el calor
No puede estar mejor!
Zu-zu-zumba!
Esto esta como, como pa, como pa', como pa' rumbiar
Pa' bailarlo caliente, de espalda y de frente
Nos favorece el sol, un bronceado y el calor
No puede estar mejor!
Zu-zu-zumba!
Subela y bajala y por debajo pasala
Suelta la cadera y mueve todo lo que tienes ahí
Sigue, siguelo así que el party no tiene fin
Activao, brinca la casa candela gasta las suelas
Funde esa tela, si que me paso que?
Suena, la rumba es buena que hay muchas nenas
Mira la escena que
Oh eh oh!
Mano arriba no la dejes caer
Oh eh oh!
Seguimos hasta el amanecer
Vamos cogele, ritmo, cintura, rodillas al piso
Baja y pasa el limbo
Vamos cogele, ritmo, cintura, rodillas al piso
Baja y pasa el limbo
Y esto esta como, como pa, como pa', como pa' rumbiar
Pa' pasarla caliente, con toda mi gente
Nos favorece el sol, un bronceado y el calor
No puede estar mejor!
Zu-zu-zumba!
Y esto esta como, como pa, como pa', como pa' rumbiar
Pa' bailarlo caliente, de espalda y de frente
Nos favorece el sol, un bronceado y el calor
No puede estar mejor!
Zu-zu-zumba!
Bailando así es que me gusta, como la cintura al ritmo se ajusta
Que me tiene loco toda esta soltura
Su movimiento es una dulzura
No importa las bameras, se forma el sal pa' fuera
Aquí cabe todo el que quiera
No lo pare ahora
Dime oh eh oh!
Mano arriba no la dejes caer
Oh eh oh! Seguimos hasta el amanecer
Vine llegando de Aruba, gozando la temperatura
Yo te vi bailando limbo
Me barriste puesto en la esquina
Dj par de bocina
Si todos llegaran por el ritmo
Esto esta como, como pa, como pa', como pa' rumbiar
Pa' pasarla caliente, con toda mi gente
Nos favorece el sol, un bronceado y el calor
No puede estar mejor!
Zu-zu-zumba!
Esto esta como, como pa, como pa', como pa' rumbiar
Pa' bailarlo caliente, de espalda y de frente
Nos favorece el sol, un bronceado y el calor
No puede estar mejor!
Zu-zu-zumba!

‘The parents have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.
Instead, everyone will die for their own sin; whoever eats sour grapes—their own teeth will be set on edge.
Jeremiah 31: 29-30

"LETRA
Otra vez
Zion & Lennox
De solo verte me dan ganas
Precisamente en Cartagena
Después de tanto me buscas
Por qué será
Por qué a mí
Ye
No te puedes ir sin contestar esa pregunta
Qué es lo que quieres
Qué necesidad es la que tienes
Para seducirme otra vez
Besarme otra vez
Volverme a poner el mundo al revés
Pa' besarte como ayer
Sentirte otra vez
Me vuelves a poner el mundo al revés
Como ayer
De solo verte me dan ganas de viajar al pasado y rescatar
Esos momentos que tú y yo compartimos
Las ganas de rumbear
Eran noches de nunca terminar
Vivíamos en una fantasía, pero era real
Lo que sentimos
Lo que hicimos
La casualidad que nos quedamos en la misma disco
Aprovechemos que nos vimos
Lo que sentimos
Lo que hicimos
La casualidad que nos quedamos en la misma disco
Dale mami que nos fuimos
Para seducirme otra vez
Besarme otra vez
Volverme a poner el mundo al revés
Pa' besarte como ayer
Sentirte otra vez
Me vuelves a poner el mundo al revés
Como ayer
Hoy vuelve a aparecer bajo la luna llena, sirena
Precisamente en Cartagena
Déjame, revivir esto es un placer
Baila que la noche es tuya, que el ritmo influya
Ponle picante, que el amor fluya
Y nos dimos cuenta que no había un final
Esto no tiene por qué terminar
Lo que sentimos (mamacita)
Lo que hicimos
No es casualidad que nos quedamos en la misma disco
Aprovechemos que nos vimos
Lo que sentimos (mamacita)
Lo que hicimos
No es casualidad que nos quedamos en la misma disco
Dale mami que nos fuimos
Para seducirme otra vez
Besarme otra vez
Volverme a poner el mundo al revés
Pa' besarte como ayer
Sentirte otra vez
Me vuelves a poner el mundo al revés

DDU-DU DDU-DU — They are finding it hard to be in love and just want a relationship 
Forever Young — After they find love, they talk about their future, like they will have a forever
Really — They are having conflict and having second thoughts
See U Later — They breakup
Kill This Love — After realising they were unable to understand how weak they were they want to put a final end to this relationship 
Don’t Know What To Do — They still find it so hard to forget you so they just don’t know what to do
Kick It — They just want to overcome the wall that is ‘you’
Hope Not — They are now fed up and just want to see him happy with another person so they can both forget about each other

"SELPINK 2.0, ICE CREAM REDO

For those BLINKs that are not informed, I'll clarify the goals of BLACKPINK big fanbases from Twitter. Since the first 24 hours release of Ice Cream, we were distracted by solo stans/akgaes and filled that day with negativities. In a result, they planned to redo the collaboration. BLINKs will act like as if SELPINK is coming again. Act like we didn't know the song and lyrics. Act like it was the day when the teasers are slowly coming up. Act like it was August 28 again. We'll stream and hype like it was the first release. We'll welcome the song without complaints and enjoy it just how BLACKPINK loves this song. The set date would be September 2, 8AM KST. The teasers will be released tomorrow.

"Qué más quieres de mí
Si he pasado está a prueba de tu amor
Y no tengo el valor
De escapar para siempre del dolor
Demasiado pedir
Que sigamos en esta hipocresía
Cuánto tiempo más podré vivir
En la misma mentira

No, no vayas presumiendo, no
Que me has robado el corazón
Y no me queda nada más
Si, prefiero ser el perdedor
Que te lo ha dado todo
Y no me queda nada más
No me queda más

Ya no puedo seguir
Resistiendo esa extraña sensación
Que me hiela la piel
Como invierno fuera de estación
Tú mirada y la mía
Ignorándose en una lejanía

Todo pierde sentido
Y es mejor el vacío que el olvido

Yo prefiero dejarte partir
Que ser tu prisionero
Y no vayas por ahí
Diciendo ser la dueña de mis sentimientos

No, no vayas presumiendo, no
Que me has robado el corazón
Y no me queda nada más
Si, prefiero ser el perdedor
Que te lo ha dado todo
Y no le queda nada más

No, no vayas presumiendo, no
Que me has robado el corazón
Y no me queda nada más
Si, prefiero ser un perdedor
Que te lo ha dado todo
Y no le queda nada más
No me queda más

Qué más quieres de mí
Si el pasado está a prueba de tu amor",2020-08-26T05:24:06Z,228

Por eso hoy me vine a refugiar escuchando esta canción en lo que me sacudo la depre y sigo adelante: solo me senté un momento, al lado del camino y descansar, solo para seguir adelante!",2020-09-05T05:54:20Z,31

"Qué más quieres de mí
Si el pasado está a prueba de tu amor
Y no tengo el valor
De escapar para siempre del dolor
Demasiado pedir
Que sigamos en esta hipocresía
Cuánto tiempo más podré vivir
En la misma mentira

No, no vayas presumiendo, no
Que me has robado el corazón
Y no me queda nada más
Si, prefiero ser el perdedor
Que te lo ha dado todo
Y no me queda nada más
No me queda más

Ya no puedo seguir
Resistiendo esa extraña sensación
Que me hiela la piel
Como invierno fuera de estación
Tú mirada y la mía
Ignorándose en una lejanía

Todo pierde sentido
Y es mejor el vacío que el olvido

Yo prefiero dejarte partir
Que ser tu prisionero
Y no vayas por ahí
Diciendo ser la dueña de mis sentimientos

No, no vayas presumiendo, no
Que me has robado el corazón
Y no me queda nada más
Si, prefiero ser el perdedor
Que te lo ha dado todo
Y no le queda nada más

No, no vayas presumiendo, no
Que me has robado el corazón
Y no me queda nada más
Si, prefiero ser un perdedor
Que te lo ha dado todo
Y no le queda nada más
No me queda más

Qué más quieres de mí
Si el pasado está a prueba de tu amor",2020-03-12T12:19:19Z,462

"Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Times forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know (know)
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Times forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me
That's OK, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat
Where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's OK, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost
Back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home""

"THIS LOOK OF HIS WAS AN F'n FASHION MOMENT around the world. As some1 who is not from the western world i can tell u 4 a fact of his impact as a Megastar . Rarely do we copy a specific style of an artist from that world but we have done it for other icons like James  brown, M.J,  John Travolta' (grease look) .And it says so much abt chris and his impact as an artist around the world, not 2 mention his murals and quotes from his songs plastered along walls. But I still can't believe that in this day and age some1 can have an effect like that with Social media and everything. NATO children when i tell u chris made people in  the rest of the world dress up like him. He did his thing! .It's like they say Imitation is a huge form of flattery & c.b has millions of ppl that impersonate his fashion style,music, dancing style(z acrobatics) . When this video came out ,it became a unisex look and they copied him from the hat , to the leather jacket with white T-shirt, to the black jeans with a colorful shirt tied around their  waist and down to the timberland shoes. Like it was & still is a fashion look. What is crazy  is that, it's when u see artist like Brown that makes u realize and takes u aback that these artists really can affect the day 2 day lives of ppl around  the world. Congrats  on the Billi keep shining even brighter.",2020-09-06T19:40:05Z,12

You inspired so many people even if you don't know it,showing us that our health must be a priority. You are like a Phoenix.We know leaving 1D wasn't as easy as media says it was and I'm sorry for what mean people said to you,but we were,are and always be here for you.You were mature and knew that craziness must stop,so you left.We didn't understand that making 5 albums in 5 years wasn't normal,thinking just that you were having fun and we're sorry we didn't see it earlier. You had courage to fight for what is right and we couldn't be more grateful to stan someone like you. One Direction isn't just a boy band.. One Direction helped us learn how you can love and care about someone who doesn't even know you. We are a family and, I repeat, we will always be there for you.  Thank you for all that you've done and we hope that you're happy.  Love you, Dj Malik.❤",2020-09-09T07:02:02Z,8
