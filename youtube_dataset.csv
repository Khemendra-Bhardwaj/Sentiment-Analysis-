"""Shape Of You""

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (mmmm)
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mmmm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now (mmmm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date (mmmm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (mmmm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay (mmmm)
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (See you in a better place)
Uh

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & (Wiz Khalifa)]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (Yeah, we came a long way) from where we began
(You know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home",2019-11-22T15:55:49Z,6003

"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart

"lyrics :
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, no more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars
Yeah, we'll be countin' stars
I see this life like a swingin' vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashin' signs
Seek it out and ye shall find
The old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told
I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, no more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, no more countin' dollars, we'll be
We'll be countin' stars
Hey, yeah
I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
The hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told
And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, no more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, no more countin' dollars, we'll be
We'll be countin' stars
Oh
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be

"Jesus is coming soon!!!!
BELIEVE IN HIM RIGHT NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!!!!
A - Admit you're a sinner.
""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."" - Romans 3:23 (KJV)
We were all born sinners, that's why we must be born again spiritually to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
B - Believe Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior
""That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation."" - Romans 10:9-10 (KJV) This scripture is tying into the belief of the Gospel of Grace (1 Corinthians 15:1-4).
C - Call Upon the Name of the Lord
None of us are perfect, that is why we need Jesus in our lives. ""As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one."" - Romans 3:10 (KJV)
But Romans 10:13 states that ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.""",2020-09-08T02:19:17Z,1

"Letra en espa√±ol:
Yo te miro, se me corta la respiraci√≥n
Cuanto tu me miras se me sube el coraz√≥n
(Me palpita lento el corazon)
Y en silencio tu mirada dice mil palabras
La noche en la que te suplico que no salga el sol
(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)
Tu cuerpo y el mio llenando el vac√≠o
Subiendo y bajando (subiendo y bajando)
(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)
Ese fuego por dentro me esta enloqueciendo
Me va saturando
Con tu f√≠sica y tu qu√≠mica tambi√©n tu anatom√≠a
La cerveza y el tequila y tu boca con la m√≠a
Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas) Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas)
Con esta melod√≠a, tu color, tu fantas√≠a
Con tu filosof√≠a mi cabeza esta vac√≠a
Y ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas)
Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas)

Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo
Bailar contigo, tener contigo
Una noche loca (una noche loca)
Ay besar tu boca (y besar tu boca)
Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo
Bailar contigo, tener contigo una noche loca
Con tremenda loca
(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
Tu me miras y me llevas a otra dimensi√≥n
(Estoy en otra dimensi√≥n)
Tu latidos aceleran a mi coraz√≥n
(Tu latidos aceleran a mi coraz√≥n)
Que iron√≠a del destino no poder tocarte
Abrazarte y sentir la magia de tu olor
(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)
Tu cuerpo y el mio llenando el vac√≠o
Subiendo y bajando (subiendo y bajando)
(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)
Ese fuego por dentro me esta enloqueciendo
Me va saturando
Con tu f√≠sica y tu qu√≠mica tambi√©n tu anatom√≠a
La cerveza y el tequila y tu boca con la m√≠a
Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas)
Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas)
Con esta melod√≠a, tu color, tu fantas√≠a
Con tu filosof√≠a mi cabeza esta vac√≠a
Y ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas)
Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas)
Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo
Bailar contigo, tener contigo
Una noche loca (una noche loca)
Ay besar tu boca (y besar tu boca)
Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo
Bailar contigo, tener contigo una noche loca
Con tremenda loca
(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
Ooooh bailando amor ooooh
Bailando amor ooooh es que se me va el dolor
Ooooh).",2020-08-27T11:57:16Z,95

We would walk on the sidewalk
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other

But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over

When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

All we need is somebody to lean on

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

"I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
'Cause I'm capable of anything
Of anything and everything

Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse

Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away, don't walk away

It's in the palm of your hand now baby
It's a yes or no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it up to me
Up to me, give it up to me

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

She's a beast
I call her Karma
She eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer
Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart was on steroids
'Cause her love was so strong

You may fall in love
When you meet her
If you get the chance you better keep her
She swears by it but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon' put her in a coma

Woo! Damn I think I love her
Shawty so bad
I'm sprung and I don't care
She got me like a roller coaster
Turn the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil' mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back",2019-11-13T16:43:53Z,204

Trying to make things right between us
And now it's all good baby
Roll that Backwood baby
And play me close

'Cause girls like you
Run around with guys like me
'Til sundown, when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

Girls like you
Love fun, yeah me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah

I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

I need a girl like you

Maybe it's 6:45
Maybe I'm barely alive
Maybe you've taken my shit for the last time, yeah
Maybe I know that I'm drunk
Maybe I know you're the one
Maybe I'm thinking it's better if you drive

'Cause girls like you
Run around with guys like me
'Til sundown, when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

'Cause girls like you
Run around with guys like me
'Til sundown, when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

Girls like you
Love fun, yeah me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah

"Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
Love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dive too deep

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go
Oh oh oh no
And you let her go
Oh oh oh no

I know that i`ve acted stupid
But whenever i see you so far away
I wish i could play cupid

I want you so badly
This is what i`m seeking
But so sadly
Your heart is somewhere leaking

If i go the distance
I`ll be right where i belong
But it is your existence
Is all that keeps me strong

Please don`t leave me
Maybe we will find a way
I know that i have hurt you
But please i want you to stay..

Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret
That the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (other side)

Hello, it's me

They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be

I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

Hello from the other side

For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

"Lyrics if you'd like to scream along:

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret
That the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home

Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore

Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore

Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)

"Waka Waka lyrics

Oooeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehh

You're a good soldier
Choosing your battles
Pick yourself up
And dust yourself off
Get back in the saddle

You're on the front line
Everyone's watching
You know it's serious
We're getting closer
This isn't over

The pressure's on
You feel it
But you got it all
Believe it

When you fall get up, oh oh
If you fall get up, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
'Cause this is Africa

Tsamina mina, eh eh
Waka waka, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa

Listen to your God
This is our motto
Your time to shine
Don't wait in line
Y vamos por todo

People are raising
Their expectations
Go on and feed them
This is your moment
No hesitation

Today's your day
I feel it
You paved the way
Believe it

If you get down get up, oh oh
When you get down get up, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa

Tsamina mina, eh eh
Waka waka, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa

Well give me what you have there
Pues dame de eso que tienes ah√≠

Hey baby don't be bad
Oye baby no seas mala

Do not leave me with the desire

Como t√∫ me tientas cuando t√∫ te mueves

That sexy move always entertains me
Ese movimiento sexy siempre me entretiene

You know how to manipulate me well with your hips
Sabes manipularme bien con tus caderas

I don't know why you have me on the waiting list
No s√© porqu√© me tienes en lista de espera

They tell you that I'm doing and undoing
Te dicen por ah√≠ que voy haciendo y deshaciendo

That I go out every night, that I have you there suffering
Que salgo cada noche, que te tengo ah√≠ sufriendo

That in this relationship I am the one who commands
Que en esta relaci√≥n soy yo la que mando

Don't stop at all that bad propaganda
No pares bola a toda esa mala propaganda

Pa-pa 'what do I tell you na', they eat your ear
Pa-pa'qu√© te digo na', te comen el o√≠do

Do not straighten what has not been twisted
No vaya a enderezar lo que no se ha torcido

And like a madman I follow after you
Y como un loco sigo tr√°s de t√≠

Muriendo por ti

Dime que hay pa'mi, beb√©

Yo te quiero aunque no quieras

T√∫ eres puro, puro chantaje

No soy de ti ni de nadie

Como t√∫ me tientas cuando t√∫ te mueves
Ese movimiento sexy siempre me entretiene
Sabes manipularme bien con tus caderas
No s√© porqu√© me tienes en lista de espera

Te dicen por ah√≠ que voy haciendo y deshaciendo
Que salgo cada noche, que te tengo ah√≠ sufriendo
Que en esta relaci√≥n soy yo la que mando
No pares bola a toda esa mala propaganda
Pa-pa'qu√© te digo na', te comen el o√≠do
No vaya a enderezar lo que no se ha torcido

Y como un loco sigo tr√°s de t√≠
Muriendo por ti
Dime que hay pa'mi, beb√©

""Believer""

First things first
I'mma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh
The way that things have been, oh ooh

Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh
The blood in my veins, oh ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Rest in peace üíî

Guess all I have now is the ring and the song. I might try writing her a letter tho. Maybe send it on our 1 year anniversary.

"Lyrics : 
I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in
And follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
Darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, we're listenin' to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listenin' to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Oh, no, no
Mm

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, we're listenin' to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
No, I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight

I found a love for me
Darling just dive right in
And follow my lead
Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet¬†
I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me..
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love, not knowing what it was I will not give you up this time..
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own and in your eyes you're holding mine..

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listenin' to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home..
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own..
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time..
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listenin' to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, O listenin' to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserved it
You look perfect tonight.

We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

I just heard you found the one you've been looking‚Äî
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

Don't wanna know
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

[Selena Gomez:]
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you might want me to
Come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez:]
That we don't talk anymore
(we don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore
(we don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
(we don't, we don't)
What was all of it for?
(we don't, we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

Like we used to do

Don't wanna know
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore

"LYRICS :-
We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)

We don't talk anymore

Don't wanna know

Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain

I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you might want me to
Come show up at your door

Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes

"LYRICS
(feat. Anne-Marie & Sean Paul)

[Sean Paul:]
Call it love and devotion
Call it a mom's adoration
Foundation
A special bond of creation,
Ha

For all the single moms out there
Going through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean-da-Paul, Anne-Marie
Sing, make them hear

[Anne-Marie:]
She works at nights by the water
She's gone astray so far away
From my father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him

Trying to keep out the cold

"Lyrics :
[Chorus]
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines working that Photoshop
We know that shit ain't real, come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty booty)
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into then go ahead and move along

[Chorus]
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass


[Verse 2]
Hey, I'm bringing booty back
Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that
No, I'm just playing I know you think you're fat
But I'm here to tell you
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty booty)
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into then go ahead and move along

[Chorus]
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble

[Verse 1: Camila]
I ain't worried 'bout nothin', I ain't wearin' na-nada
I'm sittin' pretty, impatient, but I know you gotta
Put in them hours, I'ma make it harder
I'm sending pic after picture, I'ma get you fired

[Pre-Chorus: Normani]
I know you're always on the night shift
But I can't stand these nights alone
And I don't need no explanation
Cause baby, you're the boss at home

[Chorus: Lauren]
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work
Work, work, work
But you gotta put in work, work, work, work
Work, work, work
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work
Work, work, work
Let my body do the work, work, work, work
Work, work, work
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Ally]
Let's put it into motion, I'ma give you a promotion
I'll make it feel like a vacay, turn the bed into an ocean
We don't need nobody, I just need your body
Nothin' but sheets in between us, ain't no getting off early

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh yeah, girl go to work for me (Work for me)
Can you make it clap, no hands for me?
Take it to the ground, pick it up for me
Look back at it all over me (Oh yeah)
Put in work like my timesheet
She ride it like a '63
I'ma buy her new C√©line
Let her ride in a foreign with me
Oh, she the bae, I'm her boo
And she down to break the rules
Ride or die,¬†she gon' go
I'm gon' juug, she finessin'
I pipe her, she take that
Put in overtime on your body

Can we just take time and appreciate that tiktok didn't ruin this song.,2020-05-09T21:58:53Z,27975
"The song is about ""alcoholism and depression"", look at the apartment, the disorder and the things on the floor, it seems like the home of a depressed person, the dancer is totally alone, nobody accompanies her in her suffering.
The phrase ""push it down"" refers to whether or not to drink a glass.
The phrase ""Help me"" is a call for help, but it goes almost unnoticed.
The dance also has many meanings, she dances playing someone drunk and depressed, she shows all her emotions without anyone caring, no one is watching her.
The dancer (Maddie Ziegler) has her hands painted pink, this means blood from suicide attempts, the author did not want to use red to avoid being so controversial.
There is a lot of meaning in the dance, almost everything has to do with the context of the song, the rest is dance to accompany and make transitions.

At 00:12 I am a party girl, I am with a drink in my hand, do I drink it or not drink it? I push it down and I raise it again, I am undecided, I have to leave it, when will I learn?
At 00:27 she talks on the phone and is invited to go out partying, while holding a glass of wine. It is time to drink nonstop and lose your mind.
At 00:55 I am hurt, I am like a dog in a wheelchair that crawls with wheels towards the corner, but I get up with difficulty.
At 01:00 Everything has passed, now I am happy for life and without worries, everything is fine. But then I fall back from above, time to drink and do crazy things, to have a good time.
At 01:22 the stomach demands food. I'm drunk, I almost lose my balance. I say goodbye with a kiss to everyone. Nobody helps me, don't worry about me, I hold my hair myself and go.
At 01:34 it is time to sit down to eat spaghetti, I take the fork I stab it on the wall and throw it. Now I have passed out and I wake up again, I scare the flies on each side, now a cockroach climbs the wall, I clean my mouth, the food was horrible, now my stomach hurts.
At 02:01 Playing dice, I am now a gansgter. I shake and shake the bad off me, I go to a corner to cry.
At 02:24 she runs to the window but stops and turns with a scared face and backs up with trembling steps.
At 02:32 she cuts her veins in each hand and says goodbye, then she goes to the street and knocks on doors for help, nobody responds.
At 02:42 she leans against the wall, she is exhausted and depressed, she is about to fall apart. Pause the minute 02:44, it is the best scene, you can see his depressed face and his body about to fall. Then she runs jumping every obstacle on her way.
At 02:56 I open my eye, I hardly have any signs of life. The tears run down her face, she tries to commit suicide by hanging herself with the curtains, her air runs out and she says goodbye to everyone (she observes that the curtains have blood stains).
At 03:12 I am looking for someone to take refuge in, but love is not pious with me, I repress it, I repress it.
At 03:26 It is time to get up and continue pretending before everyone, I walk a tightrope and smile falsely at everyone, my face changes from happy to sad, I lie to them, I'm fine.
""Chandelier"" is about someone drunk, imagine someone who drinks until they lose their minds and don't care about anything, hangs on even a candlestick, let's live regardless of tomorrow.
The video has many more meanings than the ones I have mentioned and is fully choreographed.

Sorry for my English, Google translator.",2020-07-08T07:23:08Z,29121

(nothing wrong with  any length if that is your style)  Love her look!    The exact sexy length my hair used to be back in early  2011.  It has been  an horrific experience trying to grow it back since the weak ends nightmare began 2011/2012.  To get back to that length and longer has been a constant/ church goer disappointment.

"Lyrics : ‚úèÔ∏è¬†

Talking in my sleep at night

Making myself crazy
[Out of my mind] x2
Wrote it down and read it out
Hoping it would save me 
[Too many times] x2
My love_____
He makes me feel like nobody else
Nobody else 
Oh my love_____ 
He doesn‚Äôt love me so I‚Äôm to myself
I‚Äôm to myself


1. Don‚Äôt pick up the phone
You know he‚Äôs only calling because he‚Äôs drunk and alone
2. Don‚Äôt let him in
You‚Äôll have to kick him out again
3. Don‚Äôt be his friend 
You know you‚Äôre gonna wake up in his bed in the morning 
And if you‚Äôre under him
You ain‚Äôt getting over him

(Chorus)
I got new rules I countin‚Äô 
(High Pitched H. P.) I got new rules I countin‚Äô
(H.P) I gotta tell em‚Äô to myself
(HP) I got new rules I countin‚Äô
(H.P) I gotta tell em‚Äô to myself
 
I keep pushing forwards and he keeps pulling backwards 
[No way to time] x2                                                     (No way! No!)
Now I‚Äôm sending back from it 
I finally see the pattern 
[I never learned] x2 
Well my love___
He doesn‚Äôt love me so I‚Äôm to myself
I‚Äôm to myself
I do. I DO! I DOOO!

1. Don‚Äôt pick up the phone
You know he‚Äôs only calling because he‚Äôs drunk and alone
2. Don‚Äôt let him in
You‚Äôll have to kick him out again
3. Don‚Äôt be his Friend 
You know your gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you‚Äôre under him
You ain‚Äôt getting over him

(Chorus)

I got new rules I countin‚Äô
(H.P) I got new rules I countin‚Äô
(H.P) I gotta tell em‚Äô to myself
(H.P) I got new rules I countin‚Äô
(H.P) I gotta tell em‚Äô to myself

Practice makes perfect
I‚Äôm still tryin‚Äô to learn it because I
Got new... x2 (fades)
Eat sleep and breathing 
Rehearsing repeating 
Because I...
Got new... (fades)


(1.2.3)
1. Don‚Äôt pick up the phone                                                         (Yeah)
You know he‚Äôs only calling because he‚Äôs drunk and alone 
2. Don‚Äôt let him in                                                                   (Ohoh!) 
You‚Äôll have to kick him out again 
3. Don‚Äôt be his friend                                                                     (Morning)
You know you‚Äôre gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if your under him
You ain‚Äôt getting over him

"I love this song, it's super catchy, I didn't know it was by Dua Lipa, in fact, before I met her, that song had appeared on TV and I said what an incredible song and I sang it ALL the good time Well, two years passed and I met Dua Lipa and her voice seemed to me that I had already heard her so I had a hunch and I started looking for the song like crazy. I found her and realized that they were the the same girl and well now I adore her although I don't listen to her music so much and that was the story of how I met Dua Lipa. üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è Half complicated the matter",2020-09-07T21:17:42Z,1

"LYRICS 

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me
And I love it, wait
Where you going? I'm leaving you
No you ain't, come back
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude?
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face,
Spewing venom in your words, when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over it controls you both
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie",2020-08-28T20:59:13Z,107

At the age of 15 I‚Äôve listened to all of Em‚Äôs songs and have all of his albums. I have them all on DVD‚Äôs and have copies on iTunes. He‚Äôs my idol and one day I hope to be like him. My dad was a musician but didn‚Äôt make it far then turned to alcohol and drugs. He took all the money in my savings account that was gonna be for college and used it on girls and drugs. Please let my story get far. This means a lot. Lots of people say things about my talent. I don‚Äôt drop there. I play sports so maybe I can get a scholarship to college for basketball and football in case I don‚Äôt make it in the music industry.,2020-09-07T22:03:55Z,47

"Hey Im the Lyrics Guy üòÅ

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me
And I love it, wait
Where you going? I'm leaving you
No you ain't, come back
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude?
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face,
Spewing venom in your words, when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over it controls you both
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie",2020-08-29T14:46:17Z,47

"letra: 
Cuatro abrazos y un caf√©
Apenas me despert√©
Y al mirarte record√©
Que ya todo lo encontr√©
Tu mano en mi mano
De todo escapamos
Juntos, ver el sol caer
(Let them enjoy the Paradise)
Vamos pa' la playa, pa‚Äô curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe viendo tu cintura
T√∫ le coqueteas, t√∫ eres buscabulla y me gusta
Lento y contento
Cara al viento
Lento y contento
Cara al viento
(Farru)
Y aprovecha que el sol 't√° caliente
Y vamo' a disfrutar el ambiente
V√°mono‚Äô a meternos pa'l agua
Pa' que veas qu√© rico se siente
Y v√°mono' en tropical
Por to'a la costa a chinchorrear
De chinchorro a chinchorro
Paramo' a darno' una Medalla

Bien fr√≠a pa' bajar la sequ√≠a
Un poco de Bob Marley
Y unos tragos ‚Äôe sangr√≠a
Pa‚Äô que te sueltes
Poco a poquito
Porque pa' vacilar
No hay que salir de Puerto Rico
Y dale lento
Date un shot de Coquito
Y como dice Fonsi
Vamo‚Äô a darle despacito
Pa' que te suelte'
Poco a poquito
Porque pa' vacilar
No hay que salir de Puerto Rico
Vamos pa‚Äô la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe viendo tu cintura
T√∫ le coqueteas, t√∫ eres buscabulla
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe viendo tu cintura
T√∫ le coqueteas, baby, t√∫ est√°s dura y me gusta
Lento y contento
Cara al viento
Lento y contento
Cara al viento
Y darle lento, meterle violento
Te puse reggaeton pa' que me apagues ese cuerpo
M√©tele hasta abajo, est√° duro ese movimiento
El √∫nico testigo que tenemos aqu√≠ e' el viento
Y dale, m√©tele cintura
M√°tame con tu hermosura
Mira c√≥mo me frontea
Porque sabe que est√° dura

Calma, mi vida, con calma
Que nada hace falta
Si estamos juntitos andando
Calma, mi vida, con calma
Que nada hace falta
Si estamos juntitos bailando
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe viendo tu cintura
T√∫ le coqueteas, t√∫ eres buscabullas
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe viendo tu cintura
T√∫ le coqueteas, baby, t√∫ est√°s dura
Y me gusta

"WAKE ME UP - AVICII
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
feeling my way through the darkness
guided by a beating heart
i can't tell where the journey will end
but i know where to start
they tell me i'm too young to understand
they say i'm caught up in a dream
well life will pass me by if i don't open up my eyes
well that's fine by me

so wake me up when it's all over
when i'm wiser and i'm older
all this time i was finding myself
and i didn't know i was lost

so wake me up when it's all over
when i'm wiser and i'm older
all this time i was finding myself
and i didn't know i was lost

i tried carrying the weight of the world
but i only have two hands
i hope i get the chance to travel the world
and i don't have any plans
i wish that i could stay forever this young
not afraid to close my eyes
life's a game made for everyone
and love is a prize

so wake me up when it's all over
when i'm wiser and i'm older
all this time i was finding myself
and i didn't know i was lost

so wake me up when it's all over
when i'm wiser and i'm older
all this time i was finding myself
and i didn't know i was lost

i didn't know i was lost
i didn't know i was lost
i didn't know i was lost
i didn't know i was lost

"LYRICS
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything.

Uh!
I'm gonna kick my feet up
Then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't

I'll be lounging on the couch,
Just chillin' in my snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man

Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all!
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh

Tomorrow I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out: 'This is Great' (Oh my God, this is great)
Yeah

I might mess around, get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait
Haha

Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all
Nothing at all

Step up fast and be the first girl to make me throw this cash

We just wanna see (You shake it now!)
Now you wanna be (You're naked now!)

"For English people that don‚Äôt know what does this says 

This song is about she, she says she prefers old guys instead of young people as she to hang out with and well in the video u can see she just want them by their money 
The lyrics says 
‚ÄúI like that they treat me like a lady, even though sometimes I forgot when we are on the bed 
I like that they tell me poetry in the ear at night when we‚Äôre doing other things.
I like interesting gentleman that can be a good friend and at the same time a good lover, It doesn‚Äôt care a few more years,
I like them older, those called sirs, the kind that open you the car door and send you flowers
I like them bigger that doesn‚Äôt fit me in the mouth 
The kisses he wants to gives me, that he drives me crazy‚Äù

"I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spider-Man's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list
But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not lookin' for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairy-tale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this
I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits
She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not lookin' for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairy-tale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can miss
I want something just like this
I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not lookin' for somebody

"For anyone who wants to know the storyline between the videos listen here!

So the whole thing starts with The Hills in which The Weeknd gets in a car crash and then he emerges as well as a girl with him. The car in this video is actually a representation of his old self (Trilogy Weeknd) and when he emerges from the now destroyed car it is his new mainstream self (the freeform dreads represent this and he is very aware of the mainstream route hes taking btw), the girl is the fans always nagging at him to go back to who he used to be and keep nagging at him until the car explodes representing theres no more ""old"" Weeknd anymore this is who he is now. So he keeps walking until he walks into a mansion where in the top room there is genderless person (I really dont what gender it is), with a bunch of sexualized girls around it (also note the room is tinted red like hell), this person represents the devil.

The story line continues in I Cant Feel My Face where Mr. XO is performing on a stage at a classy bar it seems. This video doesnt really have much until we see the devil (the genderless person) looking deeply at the Weeknd. This implys that the devil is the music industry making him perform, as when he sees this person his dancing intensifies until the devil catches him on fire. This shows he will perform through anything just to get the person (devil/music industry) to like him, this makes sense considering his last album was great but definetly more mainstream than previously before.

Then we go to Tell Your Friends where at the very beginning the new mainstream Weeknd is burying the old one, but you can see the old Weeknd struggling in the plastic bag while being buried implying hes getting buried alive. After burying him the mainstream Weeknd walks forward and keeps doing so until he sees the devil. In which then he shoots it killing it. He has now killed what controls him and gets in the car and drives off looking to see what the future holds him. However he sees that hes still not as happy as he was before The Hills so...

We have Starboy where the mainstream dreaded Weeknd is sitting in his beautiful home until his old self comes up behind him and strangles the mainstream Weeknd with the own plastic bag he buried him alive with. Then we see the old Weeknd who has the short Trilogy flattop again. We see him with a cross symbolizing either The Weeknd has found Christ, or more simply is using the cross as a representation of resurrection. He then goes around his house destroying all the memorabilia that represented the mainstream Weeknd. However after this he goes in a car with a cat which shortly after turns into a panther this could be him saying hes going back to his bigger and better self but I dont really know. So in the end in all this I think this Starboy video shows us hes back to making he likes as well as what we like. 

PLEASE LIKE THIS COMMENT I SPENT SO MUCH TIME DECYPHERING ALL THE VIDEOS CONNECTED!!!

He also says in Tell Your Friends, ""We are not the same I am too reckless, I dont wanna go in that direction."" And all of this is being said while his old self is being buried, (his old self still has the dreads because at this time he didnt want to cut them off until for Starboy.)

Wow, its obvious in the new album that he's embracing this pop sound. He will eventually see the downsides and go back. 

Edit: I just watched M A N I A and there is more to be said about the panther im just trying to process it. If I do decypher that video it will be on M A N I A.",2016-11-25T21:23:50Z,6063

"Lyrics : 

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning,
No kidding,
I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind

I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy,
Don't know what hit me,

But I'll be alright
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you

You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, ohoh
How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too

The world is beating you down,
I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse

My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing,
It's ringing, in my head for you

Love your curves and all your edges

I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning

Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, ohoh
Give me all of you
Cards on the table,
We're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges

All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you

What would I do without your smart 
mouth?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning,
No kidding,
I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind

I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy,
Don't know what hit me,

But I'll be alright
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you

You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, ohoh
How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too

The world is beating you down,
I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse

My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing,
It's ringing, in my head for you
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges

"Once Albert Einstein was sitting right next an indian man on a flight, Einstein told him that he is a great scientists from Germany. Einstein make a bet with him that ""I will ask you a question and if you are not able to answer it then you will give me 5$,
then you ask me question and if am not able to answer then i will give u 500$.

The man thinks 5$ : 500$ seems like a good ratio so he says sure.

Einstein asks what is the distance between Earth and the moon?
The man hands over 5$ to him and replied I don't know.

Now its the Indian man turn to ask Einstein a question. He asks ""which animal goes up a mountion with 3 legs and comes down with 4?""

Einstein thinks and thinks ü§îand finally hands over 500$ to the man.
The man took 500$ and went to sleep.

Einstein is so much annoyedüò†, he woke up the man and said hey I had given you 500$ and just tell me

Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Verse 2]
I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico
Say the word and we go (Say it)
You can be my freaka (Brrrt!)
Girl, I'll be a fleeko
Mamacita
I will never make a promise that I can't keep
I promise that your smile ain't gon' never leave
Shopping sprees in Paris
Everything 24 karats
Take a look in that mirror
Now tell me who's the fairest
Is it you? (Is it you?) Is it me? (Is it me?)
Say it's us (Say it's us) and I'll agree, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

[Chorus]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Bridge]
If you say you want a good time
Well here I am baby, here I am baby
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind (What's on your mind)
If you want it, girl come and get it
All this is here for you
Tell me baby, tell me, tell me baby
What you tryna do


[Chorus]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair

He didn't walk up with that ""how you doin'?"" (uh)

He said there's a lot of girls I can do with (uh)
(But I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute (hey)

And papa says he got malo in him (uh)
He got me feelin' like

I loved him when I left him

"This Girl deserves the world...Romance should have gone bigger. Camilizers' lets do something!!!
I suggest we pick one of her songs at a time, set a realistic  target for it to cross. Listen to it and once we have completed the target and are satisfied, we move on to the next song.


I say we start with *First Man* the video she released on fathers day...it's on 1.9M views right now on youtube...let's make it cross 50M! I know it's difficult but us Camilizers can do anything!!
Let's give her all the love we can!! Camilizers rockkk!!!!

"You used to, you used to
Yeah

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rollin' up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touchin' road?
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rollin' up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touchin' road?
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone

"English lyrics:
I like my reggae
Tiritiritiririti-daddy
Evo Jedis
When i saw her
I said: ""if that woman were for me""
Forgive me, I had to tell you
'You are tough, tough
Hard, hard, hard
How tough, hand up because you look good
'You are tough mamacita, you left level
Hard, look how your skin shines
'You're tough, tell me, tell me, how is it?
'You're tough, I'll give you a twenty out of ten'
'You're tough, tough, tough
You are the machine, the dance machine
If you don't have anyone, come to my arms
That perfume is felt in the air
Something like Argentina, you bring me the Buenos Aires
'So powerful, mean scandalous
There will be many women but you are something else
If it were a crime that you are beautiful
I arrest you in my bed and I put the wife on you '
You got the touch, touch, touch
Look at the material, special edition
You got the touch, touch, touch
Forgive me, I had to tell you
'You are tough, tough
Hard, hard, hard
How tough, hand up because you look good
'You are tough mamacita, you left level
Hard, look how your skin shines
'You're tough, tell me, tell me, how is it?
'You're tough, I'll give you a twenty out of ten'
'You're tough, tough, tough
I like the way that ram pam pam moves
My mind scheming on a plan plan plan
If he leaves me, in that curve I give him pam pam
What is your recipe I do not know, 't√° pa' eat well
I like the way that ram pam pam moves
My mind scheming on a plan plan plan
If he leaves me, in that curve I give him pam pam
Your beauty rumbles, the others pa 'the grave
One, two and three we're going to give it
The envy to shut up
Greetings to all the girls who paralyze the street
What is your name? where are you from?
Give me the number to enter with you in detail
And you got the touch, touch, touch
You look like a star making the fuss
You got the touch, touch, touch
The internet goes down when you upload a photo
When I saw her (tell me, baby girl)
I said: ""if that woman were for me"" (for me that baby)
Forgive me, I had to tell you
'You're tough (oh), tough (hey)
Hard, hard, hard
How tough, hand up because you look good
'You are tough mamacita, you left level
Hard, look how your skin shines (come on)
'You're tough, tell me, tell me, how is it? (hey)
'You're tough, I'll give you a twenty out of ten'
'You're tough, tough, tough
You have the size, another like you, mommy, there isn't
Hit it, go boom bye bye
That you have the size, another like you, mommy, there is no
Hit it, go boom bye bye
That you have the size, another like you, mommy, there is no
Hit it, go boom bye bye
That you have the size, another like you, mommy, there is no
Hit yourself, go boom bye bye, yep, yeah

Stay strong. Maybe you lost someone but, that's not the end of your story. That's the end of their part in your story. Try to make your life as beautiful as you can, I know it's easy to say but imagine how sad they feel seeing you unhappy and crying. If you are happy, they will be happy too and don't worry, you will meet them once in heaven, they are waiting. But until then try to live every day as if it's your last.

Colours and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt
Suddenly goes away somehow

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

One step closer
One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

"Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath, every hour has come to this
One step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more",2020-09-02T12:57:19Z,17

"Once Albert Einstein was sitting right next an indian man on a flight, Einstein told him that he is a great scientists from Germany. Einstein make a bet with him that ""I will ask you a question and if you are not able to answer it then you will give me 5$,
then you ask me question and if am not able to answer then i will give u 500$.

The man thinks 5$ : 500$ seems like a good ratio so he says sure.

Einstein asks what is the distance between Earth and the moon?
The man hands over 5$ to him and replied I don't know.

Now its the Indian man turn to ask Einstein a question. He asks ""which animal goes up a mountion with 3 legs and comes down with 4?""

Einstein thinks and thinks ü§îand finally hands over 500$ to the man.
The man took 500$ and went to sleep.

Einstein is so much annoyedüò†, he woke up the man and said hey I had given you 500$ and just tell me
which animal goes up a mountion with 3 legs and comes down with 4?

The Indian man gives Einstein another 5$ and replied I don't know

Pick your body up and drop it on the floor
Let the rhythm change your world on the floor
You know we're running shit tonight on the floor
Brazil, Morocco
London to Ibiza
Straight to L.A., New York
Vegas to Africa
Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
La la la la la, la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
La la la la la, la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
I know you got it, clap your hands on the floor
And keep on rockin', rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor
On the floor
Don't stop, keep it moving
Put your drinks up!
It's getting ill, it's getting sick on the floor
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I ain't wrong, we'll probably die on the floor
Brazil, Morocco
London to Ibiza
Straight to L.A., New York
Vegas to Africa
Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night way
Grab somebody, drink a little more
La la la la la, la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
La la la la la, la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
La la la la la, la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
La la la la la, la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
Break it off, kick it out
Raise the roof, wreck the dance hall
Rip these walls, light it up
Make some noise, aaaaah!
Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night way
Grab somebody, drink a little more",2020-09-03T20:29:32Z,15

"¬°CNCOwners!!!  ¬°Es muy importante!

(ESTO ES PARA EL STR3AM DE *BESO* )

Detenganse un momento por favor, Lean atentamente y hagan sus cuentas.


SOMOS 10M (supuestamente) pero digamos que solo nos esforzamos 1M... hagamos el str3@m correcto y veremos como las v!st@s suben. Si hicieramos el str3@m correcto solo con ver el MV unas 20 veces, basta y sobra. Pero ese no es el caso.

Si hici√©ramos las cosas como se deben, deberiamos pasar a los 5M en las 24 Horas.

YOUTUBE no nos est√° robando v!st@s. ¬øSaben qui√©n si? CNCOwner mism@. 

Primero que nada dejen de comentar 3m0j!s


Segundo: Disfruten el MV, v√©anlo completo desde cero hasta que termina, no se salten anuncios, DISFRUTEN DEL MV, eso es lo m√°s importante, YouTube no es pendejo y no va a dejar que solo por ver el MV unos segundos sea tomado como V!st@. Por favor reflexi√≥n, CNCO trabaja muy duro con sus canciones para solo por v!st@s meternos unos segundos y no disfrutar nada. Las cosas van a mejorar si hacemos las cosas correctamente y valoramos su trabajo, el trabajo de CNCO.

Tercero: Pasen de cinco a diez MVs m√°s de CNCO (Igualmente vean los v√≠deos completos sin saltarse los anuncios, es importante que pasen mas de 30 min antes de volver Este MV) , les doy como consejo las que est√°n por llegar al bill√≥n o las nuevas como Honey boo. Y RL, no se olviden de reggaet√≥n lento.

Seamos unidas, y sobre todo disfrutemos del MV, ver√°n que si hacemos esto las vistas subir√°n.

 YouTube las va a contar y CNCO sentir√° satisfacci√≥n al saber que CNCOwner disfruta del hermoso video que ellos se esforzaron por hacer y la canci√≥n. 


Por favor compartan la informaci√≥n, ayuden a que m√°s CNCOwners lo vean. No hagan caso a provocaciones y sigamos disfrutando del MV.


IMPORTANTE TAMBI√âN. NO VEAN LOS VIDEOS LIRYCS ni REACCIONES, AL MENOS NO DURANTE LAS PRIMERAS 24 HORAS. TENEMOS QUE LLEGAR A LOS 5M  ¬°¬°¬°si o si!!!

The content of this MV is actually about a girl gang (led by Daya) who blocked the way of The Chainsmokers' car to collect car tolls. The Chainsmokers refused to do so & the gang didn't move a muscle so they had no choice but to crash them with their car. But the gang's magical power of making cars jumping up and down by dancing had made them hovering in the air for the entire night. The name of the song is actually their calling for help.",2020-09-06T10:43:29Z,4

Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name but you're not around
I say your name but you're not around

I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-don't let me down

Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, don't let me down, down, down

Running out of time

But now there's nobody by my side

I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most

Fun fact:Your'e not watching in full screen.,2020-09-04T14:18:49Z,13
"hey you! The person behind the screen reading this! I just want you to know your a beautiful, nice person. If some one says your not good, who even are they? You have the chance to make your story SHINE. So do it! Here is something to do time-to-time.

Go hang out with a old friend.(on zoom or something obviously)
Go do what you like.
Eat a food that you enjoy.

All of those little things can make you better and happier as a person!

I know I‚Äôm just a stranger but you might be going through a though time, and I am not trying to get a lot of likes but I want people to see this and feel better 
about them self.
And yes your a stranger but beautiful in someone‚Äôs eyes! 


Now at days we determine are-self by society, and how great someone is determined by their looks, not actions So I would like to make a change by making society different.



Sorry for any grammar issues in this!
And for the creator of this video, this is a master piece! It brightened my day!
Credit to my therapist that told me some of these things lmao. My final message: YOU. ARE. WORTH. IT!!!

Aqu√≠ en la altura est√°n fuertes los vientos
Ponte el cintur√≥n y coge asiento
A tu jeva ya la vi por dentro (yes)
El dinero nunca pierde tiempo (no, no)
Contra la pared (t√∫ lo sabe')
Y le tuve que comprar un trago porque la ten√≠as con sed
Desde ac√° qu√© rico se ve
No soy Sky pero romp√≠ el bajo otra vez

Flores azules y quilates (Rosal√≠a)
Y si es mentira que me maten (J Balvin)
Flores azules y quilates
Y si es mentira que me maten

Esto es pa' que quede, lo que yo hago dura
(Con altura)
Demasiadas noches de travesura
(Con altura)
Vivo r√°pido y no tengo cura
(Con altura)
Ir√© joven pa' la sepultura
(Con altura)
Esto es pa' que quede, lo que yo hago dura (Siempre dura dura) (Con altura)
Demasiadas noches de travesura
(Con altura)
Vivo r√°pido y no tengo cura
(Con altura)

I like that Justin puts girls with short hair or almost bald hair in his videos too. Cause it always is seen as not feminine or ugly.. I really hate that cause I've been bald and now I have short hair and I can't do anything about it. And I don't find it that ugly or not feminine. That Justin puts these girls in his videos also shows to other people that you can still look feminine or pretty with short hair or being bald.,2015-11-14T16:13:20Z,2415

Shine bright like a diamond

Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky

You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright tonight, you and I

"Lyrics:
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me, "" I beg
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me, "" I begged
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
""Don't forget me, "" I beg
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
Never mind, I'll find someone like you

I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me, "" I beg
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me, "" I begged
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
""Don't forget me, "" I beg
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me, "" I begged
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""

"letra

Seu homem est√° na estrada, promovendo

Voc√™ disse 'mantenha nosso relacionamento em segredo'

Eu s√≥ estou tentando te tirar da friendzone

Pois voc√™ √© muito mais linda que nas fotos

N√£o consigo achar sua casa, me mande o endere√ßo

Dirigindo pelo port√£o fechado

Descobriu que eu estava vindo

Mandou suas amigas para casa

Continua tentando esconder, mas suas amigas sabem



Eu s√≥ te ligo quando s√£o cinco e meia

A √∫nica hora que eu estarei ao seu lado

Eu s√≥ te amo quando voc√™ me toca, n√£o me sente

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse √© o verdadeiro eu

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse √© o verdadeiro eu, √©

Eu s√≥ transo com voc√™ quando s√£o cinco e meia

A √∫nica hora em que eu vou te chamar de minha

Eu s√≥ gosto quando voc√™ me toca, n√£o me sente

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse √© o verdadeiro eu

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse √© o verdadeiro eu



Eu vou te falar e deixar isso bem claro

Tentar continuar com isso n√£o parece t√£o simples

Pois eu acabei de transar com duas vadias antes de te ver

Voc√™ tem que fazer isso no meu tempo

Sempre tentando me mandar para a reabilita√ß√£o

Essas drogas me fazem sentir descafeinado

Eu s√≥ quero curtir o momento

E esses filhos da m√£e querem uma reca√≠da



Eu s√≥ te ligo quando s√£o cinco e meia

A √∫nica hora que eu estarei ao seu lado

Eu s√≥ te amo quando voc√™ me toca, n√£o me sente

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse √© o verdadeiro eu

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse √© o verdadeiro eu, √©

Eu s√≥ transo com voc√™ quando s√£o cinco e meia

A √∫nica hora em que eu vou te chamar de minha

Eu s√≥ gosto quando voc√™ me toca, n√£o me sente

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse √© o verdadeiro eu

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse √© o verdadeiro eu



Colinas t√™m olhos, essas colinas t√™m olhos

Quem √© voc√™ para julgar, quem √© voc√™ para julgar?

Esconda suas mentiras, garota, esconda suas mentiras

S√≥ confie em voc√™, s√≥ em voc√™



Eu s√≥ te ligo quando s√£o cinco e meia

A √∫nica hora que eu estarei ao seu lado

Eu s√≥ te amo quando voc√™ me toca, n√£o me sente

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse √© o verdadeiro eu

Quando eu estou ferrado, esse √© o verdadeiro eu, √©

Eu s√≥ transo com voc√™ quando s√£o cinco e meia

A √∫nica hora em que eu vou te chamar de minha

"[Verse 1]
Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, ""Keep our business on the low-low""
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
[Verse 2]
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Bridge]
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge? Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies (Hide your lies, oh, baby)
Only you to trust, only you
[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

"I finally understand the video's meaning.
Towards the beginning, he was high on cocaine and decided to go on a ride to get some more, however, on his way there he f*cked up while driving the car and ended up crashing and flipping over the vehicle. Then the music video starts and The Weeknd begins to sing. Him walking slowly to the house is a symbol of him entering the gates of hell or the clouds of heaven. As he goes in the house, he realizes all the sins he committed during his lifetime, and knew he couldn't go into heaven because he had traded his soul for the money and fame. That is why he changed what door he was walking into. At the end, he finally met his destination, which is the Devil's Den, who is waiting for him. The Ladies are a symbol of the sacrifice he made for Life Fortune. The man waiting for him is the devil in a human form. After the video goes black, this means The Devil claimed his soul, which is why the video turned black.",2015-06-04T11:23:40Z,2617

then you ask me question and if am not able to answer then i will give u 500$.

The man thinks 5$ : 500$ seems like a good ratio so he says sure.

Einstein asks what is the distance between Earth and the moon?
The man hands over 5$ to him and replied I don't know.

Now its the Indian man turn to ask Einstein a question. He asks ""which animal goes up a mountion with 3 legs and comes down with 4?""

Einstein thinks and thinks ü§îand finally hands over 500$ to the man.
The man took 500$ and went to sleep.

Einstein is so much annoyedüò†, he woke up the man and said hey I had given you 500$ and just tell me
which animal goes up a mountion with 3 legs and comes down with 4?

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

Welcome to the room of people who have rooms of people
That they loved one day stocked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You're lovin' on the psychopath sitting next to you
You're lovin' on the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, ""How'd I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
Yeah, trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions
You're lovin' on the freakshow sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think, ""How did I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget
(Watch it)
(Watch it)

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
(Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
(Watch it)
Please all my friends are heathens, take it slow
(Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know

Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed
I tried to warn you just to stay away
And now they're outside ready to bust
It looks like you might be one of us",2020-09-06T18:05:36Z,49

Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And its so its so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me
Do I look okay, I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Because you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Because girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she let me
Her laugh her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday
Oh you know you know you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what your searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look ok
You know I'll say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Because girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Because girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
The way you are
The way you are
Girl your amazing
Just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change

When I start looking and comparing myself & my looks with others.

We are Imperfectly Perfect.

"Me delata la mirada
Hacerme el tonto para qu√©
Si a mi no me importa nada
Prefiero vivir y perder
Que no haber vivido nada
Si te vas
Quedar√© en un dolor
Que jam√°s conoc√≠

Como arena en el viento
Sin br√∫jula sin direcciones
Pisado y sediento
Lo mismo que ver un humano
Sin alma en el cuerpo
Si te vas
Quedar√© en un dolor
Que jam√°s conoc√≠

Andas en mi cabeza
Nena a todas horas
(No s√© c√≥mo explicarte)
El mundo me da vuelta
T√∫ me descontrolas
(No paro de pensarte)
Porque me la paso imaginando que
(Imaginando que)
Contigo me cas√©
Y por siempre te am√© (I love you, girl)

Andas en mi cabeza
Nena a todas horas
(Cada segundo, cada minuto)
El mundo me da vuelta
T√∫ me descontrolas
(Cada segundo, cada minuto)
Por ti me la paso imaginando que
(Imaginando que)
Contigo me cas√©
Y por siempre te am√©

Imag√≠nate que t√∫ conoces lo que desconoces
Yo me convierto en lobo despu√©s de las doce
Si no tuviera mi loba para que la despose
Me voy con la manada hasta que me destroce
Por que en la calle hay mucha compet eh eh!
Siempre lo bueno se corrompe eh eh!
Pero me viene otra mujer aprovech√°ndose
Cuando tu eres la que me encanta, chica!

Nunca yo me atrever√≠a a dejarte, sola
Chiqui, chiqui, chiqui, chiquitica nunca, sola
Por ti yo guarde mi pistola
Las gatitas no me controlan
Estas dudando yo lo se
Pero me quieres a la vez
Solo pide que, te de my love
Que te de my love, que te de

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas
(No s√© como explicarte)
El mundo me da vueltas, tu me descontrolas
(No paro de pensarte)
Por ti me la paso imagin√°ndo que
(Imaginando que)
Contigo me cas√©
Y por siempre te am√© (I love you, girl)

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas
(Cada segundo, cada minuto)
El mundo me da vueltas, tu me descontrolas
(Cada segundo, cada minuto)
Por ti me la paso imagin√°ndo que
(Imaginando que)
Contigo me cas√©
Y por siempre te am√©

Si tu te vas, se muere el amor
El que tu me das y llega el dolor
Ser√© un vagabundo solo en este mundo
Sin rumbo, sin rumbo
Si tu te vas (te vas), se muere el amor (amor)
El que tu me das (me das) y llega el dolor (y llega el dolor)
Ser√© un vagabundo solo en este mundo
Sin rumbo, sin rumbo

Tu eres mi musa, eres mi letra, tu eres mi armon√≠a
Eres el agua que me ahoga en la melancol√≠a
Chino y nacho y Daddy Yankee, te trajeron esta melod√≠a
Convertida en poes√≠a bebe, para que goces y vaciles tu ve
Rom√°ntico pero le metemos brutal!

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas
El mundo me da vueltas, tu me descontrolas
Por ti me la paso imaginando que
Contigo me cas√©
Y que por siempre te am√©

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas
(Cada segundo, cada minuto)
El mundo me da vueltas, tu me descontrolas
(Cada segundo, cada minuto)
Por ti me la paso imagin√°ndo que
(Imaginando que)
Contigo me cas√©
Y por siempre te am√©",2020-08-13T01:50:41Z,46

"I don‚Äôt think people actually realize the impact of lyrics. So, I‚Äôm just going to explain it (on how I see it) to satisfy my need of making sense of it.¬†P.S. I will make a summary at the bottom if you don‚Äôt want to read it all. Or maybe your not going to read it at all. Whatever floats your boat, or I guess fix your dishwasher. One more thing, I‚Äôm not doing this for likes, I‚Äôm only doing this for my enjoyment and satisfaction that I got my thoughts across. 

Verse 1:

Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

In the first verse, he reminisces about the times he had with her, particularly one time when she said she was so happy she could die. The line after that, he was hoping that she was there for him, but it still made him feel lonely. He thinks it‚Äôs love, and it still pains him to think about it. He was always lonely with her.

Verse 2:


You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

This one I can actually relate to and is probably the main reason why I chose to write this entire explanation. It‚Äôs true you can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness, or you can get sad from it. Nostalgia, remembering the good times, with his fianc√©. I get lost in it, especially in these depressing and dark times, but we should remember the past, not get stuck in it. He gets a bit more nostalgic remembering the good times. In the first verse, he says now and then except now he gets a bit sad. I think this is his recovery, and when she integrated into his life, left a hole where she came in, he started missing her more. After they broke up, he thinks he can do fine without her, he then later starts missing her even more.

Wow, one paragraph about 1 line, I‚Äôll make this quick(er).
The next is like resignation to the end, which mirrors what I said about nostalgia. If you were going to die, you think back to your happiest moments (I hope). Always the end, it‚Äôs always the end that has you wishing to go back. You never miss it until you lose it is kind of the message. Next line is simple; he realizes (presumably after a fight) how they couldn‚Äôt seek common ground, that they shouldn‚Äôt be together. A toxic relationship which is an all to real thing. She said that they could be friends, but after they realized that couldn‚Äôt work out, she started avoiding him. If you‚Äôve been dating for a while, then it‚Äôs harder to get out of a relationship. It‚Äôs hard to let go because you‚Äôre hoping it will work out. Then he says that I‚Äôm glad that we stopped pretending we could even be friends.

Verse 3:

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you‚Äôre just somebody that I used to know 3x

So after he admits their relationship is toxic, and she cuts him off, he says that she can‚Äôt completely just ignore him. She can‚Äôt just pretend like nothing ever happened, and he found acceptance. She did not accept the relationship they had and basically erase her identity. Start out fresh, which is a good idea in theory but in practice is just so wrong. She treats him like a stranger and ignores everything. He keeps bugging her (not a good idea, you need space so both of you can recover) and she changes her phone number and any records that she was there. He then accepts that as well, realizing he doesn‚Äôt need her at all anymore. Finally, all that‚Äôs left of her is his memory of her, and what she represents. A hopeful life, a happy family and something for each other to lean on.

Verse 4:

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

This time, it switches POV to her. This was a change to show her reasoning. Now that she‚Äôs out of this toxic relationship, she recalls ‚Äúall the times you screwed me over‚Äù. He was the real toxicity of this relationship. He was abusive, and manipulated her. He always blamed her for something that he did as ‚Äòleverage‚Äô. She figures out all of her troubles, struggles that she endured with him, we‚Äôre all his fault. That‚Äôs why she stooped so low, she never wanted to meet someone else. Sometimes people don‚Äôt even realize they‚Äôre toxic, it just depends on what they do. Don‚Äôt blame yourself until you actually see it without rose-tinted glasses. He wants the relationship back, but when they broke up he said he wouldn‚Äôt care about her.  She finds independence, freedom and acceptance. She finds him thinking about her and she tells him the time when they broke up. She realizes the relationship was toxic, and he gets adamant. Refuses, and when she finally wins the argument, he storms off yelling that he won‚Äôt care what would happen to her. I guess he realizes it too late, when the relationship was over.

Verse 5:

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody (I used to know)
(Somebody) Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody (I used to know)
(Somebody) Now you're just somebody that I used to know
I used to know, that I used to know, I used to know somebody

This time, he wants repentance, he wants to show her he‚Äôs changed. But, from the context of the song, their relationship must have been going on for a while. I think that‚Äôs the number one reason why she didn‚Äôt break up sooner. She felt if they just let it die down, he would change or ¬†she would change. Again, taking blame for something she didn‚Äôt do. The reason why this verse was repeated (and not just because it‚Äôs a song) was to send home the fact that she truly doesn‚Äôt care for him. The song flips the story over because at the start, he was the one who said he wouldn‚Äôt care.

Summary:This took me an hour to write, so I‚Äôm looking for LIKES! I‚Äôm just kidding, like if you want but please don‚Äôt feel forced to. This summary is how I see this songs lyrics, ok, so don‚Äôt go around complaining about how this or that, how he intended that it was made as a way to distract everyone so the U.S. government could sneak up on us while we were distracted. This song is (remember this is how I see it) about acceptance.

He recalls his relationship with her, hoping that she could be the missing piece in his puzzle and vice versa. He starts trying to remember more of her, of what she was like, getting addicted to a ‚Äúcertain kind of sadness‚Äù. ¬†Nostalgia, or the sadness of how we can‚Äôt go back to it. She wanted to be friends, but it didn‚Äôt work out and he was glad they could move on from their relationship. She cuts him off, hoping to get away from him, treating him like a stranger. She is basically gone, replaced only by his memory, just somebody that he used to know. It switches to her POV, she realizing that her relationship was toxic. He was manipulative and controlling, and she didn‚Äôt realize until they broke up. She recalls all the times he was controlling and found him stuck thinking on her, maybe looking at photos of them together. She walks up to him and tells him what happened when they broke up.¬†He said he wouldn‚Äôt care about her and she thought she would. In the end, the story flips it all and the person who finds acceptance is her.

Kudos to Rafaellarsa *Come on, take a bow* for helping me with the POV switch.

Ya no vengas m√°s con esos cuentos mami
Si desde el principio siempre estuve pa' ti
Nunca me avisaron cu√°l era el problema
Te gusta estar rodando por camas ajena
Ahora me toc√≥ a m√≠ cambiar el sistema
Andar con gatas nuevas, repartir el coraz√≥n
Sin tanta pena, ahora te digo goodbye
Muito obrigado, pa' ti ya no hay

Mas meu amor, n√£o tem problema, n√£o, n√£o
Que agora vai sobrar ent√£o (O qu√™? O qu√™?)

Hey, Macklemore, can we go thrift shopping?

What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome.

Walk into the club like ""What up? I got a big cock!""
Nah, I'm just pumped, bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
People like ""Damn, that's a cold ass honky!""
Rolling in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets (Pisssssss)
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents!
Bag it, copping it, washing it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passing up on those moccasins someone else been has walking in
Bummy and grudgy, fucking it, I am stunting and flossing and
Saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain bitch
Imma take your grandpa's style
Imma take your grandpa's style
No for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found, dig it
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my Mello
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like ""Ah, he got the Velcros!""

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

What you know about rocking a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowing about wearing a fur fox skin?
I'm digging, I'm digging, I'm searching right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donating that plaid button
Up shirt, 'cause right now, I'm up in here stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the (Uptons)
I'm that, I'm that sucker searching in this section (Uptons)
Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies, secondhand and rock that motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on that motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like ""Oh that Gucci, that's hella tight!""
I'm like ""Yo, that's fifty dollars for a t-shirt!""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a t-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting swindled and pimped, shit
I call that getting tricked by a business, that shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Trying to get girls from a brand, man, you hella won't
Man, you hella won't

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

I'll wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this big ass coat
From that thrift shop down the road

I wear your granddad's clothes (Damn right)
I look incredible (C'mon!)
I'm in this big ass coat (Big ass coat)
From that thrift shop down the road

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket

"After everyone's last breath on earth, the soul (spirit) goes to a new place; that's either Heaven or Hell. 
How is heaven? heaven is a very good place with no sins, sorrows, crying, lust, greed; in other words there is no sin there and it‚Äôs full of joy.

How is hell? Matthew 13:50 (UKJV) ‚ÄúAnd shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.‚Äù Hell is very terrible and it‚Äôs very very hot, you can‚Äôt survive placing your hand on a hot stove for 10 seconds, don‚Äôt even think you will withstand burning there without being consumed,
The thing here is you will be burned without being consumed in hell the same same way you boil a hard rock in water you will be there for eternity,
Again after judgement you will be thrown in lake of fire forever. 

Hell is a place of suffering from intense tormenting, so why choose to go there instead of going to Heaven? 

Here is the steps you must read, understand and believe in order to be sure you will be on your way to Heaven. 

Salvation
Jesus said, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me"" (John 14:6). He also said, ""I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved"" (John 10:9, NASB). Jesus is not only the way to heaven, he is also the door to heaven. 
Realise you are a sinner; Isaiah 64:6 (UKJV) But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses(the quality of being morally right) are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.

Deserving hell for sins
Realise that you deserve hell for your sins; 
Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH.¬†In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit.¬†They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later.¬†Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12).¬†Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are¬†not¬†the same.¬†Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead.¬†The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15).¬†All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at¬†The Great White Throne of Judgment¬†and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.¬†

Repent
So repent, Repenting means: to change your mind; a sincere turning away, in heart, mind and action; Therefore God wants you to repent of sinful values and of sinful living. God wants you to decide to follow Him and to make Jesus the Lord of your life.

No other way 
If you want to go to heaven, you've got to go through the door marked ""Jesus Christ."" There is no other entrance. 
By no other entrance it means belief in gods, Buddha, Muhammad or other beings or objects cannot save you; But only belief in Jesus Christ our Lord can save you.
No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus did for you as simple as that. Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Believe 
All you need to do is to truly believe with your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ suffered and got crucified and shed his blood for your sins at the cross, He was buried but rose again on the third day just to prove he was God and now alive in heaven. After that you will receive the holy spirit and you will know that you are going to heaven after death or when Jesus comes back while you are still alive.

After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c. 
As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life. Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag.",2020-09-08T14:34:58Z,2

[Justin Bieber (DJ Khaled):]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie, no

[Quavo:]
Yo, yo. Quavo
I'm the one that hit that same spot. Hit it.
She the one that bring them rain drops, rain drops.
We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch, hopscotch?
You the one that hold me down when the block's hot, hot.
I make your dreams come true when you wake up. Dream.
And your look's just the same without no make up, eh.
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of. Mama.
Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up, hey
You can run inside my life from that fame bus
'Cause I promise when we step out you'll be famous, yeah
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us. Why?

[Chance The Rapper:]
Okay, though
She beat her face up with that new Chanel
She like the price, she see the ice, it make her coochie melt
When I met her in the club I asked her who she felt
Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watching Netflix, she ain't got no cable. Okay, though.
Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her
She want a nigga that pull her hair and hold the door for her
Baby, that's only me, bitch, it okay with me
Baby, okay, okay though

'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody, not just any-fuckin'-body
Don't make me catch a body, that's for any and everybody
Oh my God! She hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch you blow my high, that's like turning gold to bronze
Roll my eyes
And when she on the molly she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie but it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God forgive me
Tunechi and finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out The Crescent, fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula Gang winning record, I'm just flexing on my exes, oh, God

Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie, no

Bitch, you blow my high, that's like turning gold to bronze
Roll my eyes
And when she on the molly she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie, but it's more like Whitney Bobby
God, forgive me
Tunechi and finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out The Crescent, fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records

"Lyrics:

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah)
To take a stand, it's been a ride
Everybody, I guess I had to
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road",2019-11-20T15:56:22Z,3011

I keep comming back over and over im in the System. This Hospital put Guardian because  I was being abused some sick stuff was going on. Im not afraid is a really good song. They experimented on me like I was a lab rat. My whole face looks distorted. I have to wait cause mu mom wants to go to court mu own family was taking my money. It's  a long story. Im a girl but most girls now are so weird. I don't know what it is the only friend I got is my mom.

Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up

"This song is simular to my life, accept its best friends, not gf and bf, if you want to know what happened, read more.





So, it all started a few years ago, I met people at my school and we became friends. and I met her my best friend ever.  My mom and dad always wanted to move since then, and they thought we were to young. Skip to a few years later, I had some more new friends, and then I met the liar friend. She always would try to replace my best friend by  agreeing with everything I say or saying we have a lot in common. She also would always wear the same outfit as me, without having any idea. I thought nothing of it so of course, I was friends with her to. Then I started playing with both of them, and then slowly faded out from her. A few years later, coronavirus started. At first we were fine, then school stopped. I had my bff‚Äôs number so I was fine. The problem is, I was moving. And since I‚Äôm popular at my school, people are gonna miss me a lot. So I started talking a lot to my bff over the phone, and FaceTimed, played roblox, and then I was a lot more into youtube. So I started always telling her ‚Äúsorry I can‚Äôt talk to you right now I‚Äôm busy.‚Äù And it went on. Then I came back one day and said, ‚ÄúI can play roblox as long as you want now!‚Äù But then, I realized the last time we talked was a month ago. I kept on feeling sad, so I tried to ignore the fact that she won‚Äôt respond. A few days later, I found out the song ‚ÄúDusk till dawn‚Äù was a thing. Now at first, I thought oh it‚Äôs just a nice beautiful song. Then I soon use it for one of my videos background music while I was editing. Then, when I was watching the video, I realized dusk till dawn was a song that seemed kinda similar to my friendship. So I started crying, nonstop that day, and I even told my friends about my friendship, so I basically cried the hole day. But then skip to a few days later again, since I‚Äôm a youtuber, I like editing. However, u decided to use gacha club to make a oc that looked like me. Then I made a edit of how I felt, ofc sad. Then the next day, I came across dusk till dawn again, and sent it to her. Skip to later, still no response, so I joined a game in roblox and talked to a girl, the game was a depressing game, ofc. So she came up to me and asked what was wrong. So I explained. After I explained she told me to move on, and she told me she probably forgot about me. I refused to believe so I kept trying. I kept saying things until I got to the point we‚Äôre I felt like she forgot about me. I kept saying nonsense, like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I try anymore.‚Äù So then I told my mother, and she said I should try to call her when her school was over. So I did, ofc again no response. So a few days later, I realized since I like editing, I should make a meme about are friendship, yes, a said meme. I have not posted it yet but I did make it. And I sent it to her. Keep in mind nos it‚Äôs been 2 months since we talked. I told her to listen to it with sound on. I hope she sees it. Time to wait patiently..",2020-09-06T20:22:03Z,7

Not tryna be cool
Just tryna be in this

Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through
All of the windows

'Cause I wanna touch you, baby
And I wanna feel you, too
I wanna see the sunrise and your sins 
Just me and you
Light it up, on the run
Let's make love, tonight
Make it up, fall in love, try
But you'll never be alone

I wanna feel you, too
I wanna see the sunrise and your sins

"Here the lyric

When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah...

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

[Verse 2]
We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine

[Chorus]
So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

[Refrain]
Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

[Bridge]
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Refrain]
Sometimes, I need some time on my own
Sometimes, I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Verse 3]
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ooh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame

[Chorus]
So, never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain",2020-08-23T16:22:57Z,116

"Guns N' Roses - November Rain (Official Music Video)

Lyrics:

When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin' when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same?

Nothin' lasts forever
And we both know heart can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

We've been through this such a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain
Oh yeah

But love is always coming 
And love is always going
And no one's really sure of who's lettin' go today
Walking away

If we could take the time
To lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
All mine

So if you want to love me
Then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

Do you need some time
On your own?
Do you need some time
All alone?

Everybody needs some time
On their own
Don't you know you need some time
All alone?

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you?

(Slash Guitar Solo)

Sometimes I need some time
On my own
Sometimes I need some time
All alone

Everybody needs some time
On their own
Don't you know you need some time
All alone?

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain
Oh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame

So never mind the darkness:
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain

Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody

You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody

You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody

You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody",2020-09-04T16:44:34Z,81

Since I had to abandon it due to lack of money and thus help my mother and my brothers, it is a donation to be able to have an income through my talent and I have gone to the airfunding donations page in which I propose what it is about My project is donations from 3 dlls, if you could help me by donating or sharing my message to more people, they would help me enormously, I leave the links, please i really need your help, they would make a big difference

Qui√©reme mientras se pueda üíñ 
que la vida es una rueda que te da mil vueltas üé°
Y al final nada queda
no he visto la primera historia üìñ

y lo mejor de esta historia üìö 
es que t√∫ eres mi compa√±er@ üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®üë¨üë≠
de esta vida pasajera

qui√©reme mientras yo te quiera üíì 
y no quiere decir que seas m√≠@
por eso guardo buenos recuerdos üí≠ en la alcanc√≠a üêñ
para recordarte por si te vas alg√∫n d√≠a
esto ha sido una poes√≠a üìñ 
que escribimos los dos üë´
√∫nicos, en cada cap√≠tulo
me quieres antes que yoüë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®
son cosas del destino
gracias a Dios üôèüôè que nos junt√≥ en el camino

Aunque te quiera pa‚Äô la eternidad üë®üèº‚Äçü¶≥üëµüèº
todo en la vida tiene su principio y su final üëª
t√∫ y yo no somos la excepci√≥n
no te sientas mal üôÅ
y si me voy que seas feliz üòäüòä antes de llorar
por eso qui√©reme en vida üòçü•∞
vivamos los d√≠as
haciendo una historia de las que no se olvidan üòÅü•∞ü§°üíØüíå‚õ∑Ô∏èüë™üë£üçÇüåáüåÖ
he visto el amor disfrazado de hipocres√≠a
el bolsillo lleno con cabezas vac√≠as ü§™ 

Hay amores tan t√≥xicos ‚ò£Ô∏è
que nadie los entiende
no son l√≥gicos ü§∑
pero cuando el amor es entre dos üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®
las mariposas ü¶ãno son c√≥lico.

"S√© que buscas a alguien que
Te vuelva a enamorar
Que no te haga sentir mal
S√© que hubo otro que
No supo valorar
Lo que ten√≠as para dar
S√© que tal vez
Te hizo sufrir
Te hizo llorar
Te supo lastimar
S√© que tal vez
Ya sabes de m√≠
Voy detr√°s de ti
No te voy a mentir
Voy buscando una lady
Como t√∫ la quiero as√≠
Quiero que te enamores
Como estoy yo de ti
A casa enviarte flores
Y en tu nombre escribir
Mil canciones de amores
Pa' que pienses en m√≠
Como yo pienso en ti
Yo quiero hablarte
Quiero hipnotizarte
Un estrella traerte
Hasta el cielo bajarte
Cantarte al o√≠do
Y ver tu piel al erizarte
Llevarte lentamente
donde estemos tu y yo aparte
Y si te provoca
Te beso la boca
Sue√±o con tocarte
Quitarte la ropa
No confundas mi intenci√≥n
Por decir cosas locas
Te quiero
Pero tu cuerpo tambi√©n me provoca
Poderte complacer
Cada uno de tus sue√±os conocer
Hablar juntos hasta el amanecer
Que seas mi mujer
Sea yo el √∫nico que te de placer
Cada d√≠a de mi vida yo poderte tener
Voy buscando una lady
Como t√∫ la quiero as√≠
Quiero que te enamores
Como estoy yo de ti
A casa enviarte flores
Y en tu nombre escribir
Mil canciones de amores
Pa' que pienses en m√≠
Como yo pienso en ti (X2)
S√© que buscas a alguien que
Te vuelva a enamorar
Que no te haga sentir mal
S√© que hubo otro que no supo valorar
Lo que ten√≠as para dar
Voy buscando una lady
Como t√∫ la quiero as√≠
Quiero que te enamores
Como estoy yo de ti
A casa enviarte flores
Y en tu nombre escribir
Mil canciones de amores
Pa' que pienses en m√≠
Como yo pienso en ti

"De verdad me gusta mucho esta canci√≥n por qu√©.....

Hace unos 2 casi 3 meses mi hermano sufri√≥ una fuerte pelea que lo dejo en coma, ya se estaba recuperando y pod√≠a hablar y moverse pero por alguna raz√≥n no lo quer√≠an dar de alta.

Yo era de le√≠ que siempre despu√©s de la escuela (voy en la tarde) iba a verlo al hospital y estaba con el haciendo muchas cosas, hablaba con el, me re√≠a con el, lloraba con el y hubo un d√≠a en el que est√°bamos escuchando m√∫sica.

Y me dijo ""pon la de una lady como t√∫"" y la puse y ambos no la sab√≠amos de memoria y juntos la cantamos, hubo un momento en que se qued√≥ callado y yo segu√≠a cantando, y en la parte de

""Voy buscando una Lady, como t√∫ la quiero as√≠"" el lo que hizo fue se√±alarme, osea como dedic√°ndome esa parte de la canci√≥n y yo por la emoci√≥n me puse a llorar y lo abrac√©.

Se fue acercando a mi y me susurro al o√≠do 

""Quiero que sepas que eres el amor de mi vida,pero en hermana"" 

Al d√≠a siguiente mi hermano falleci√≥, nunca se supo de qu√© manera o cu√°l fue la causa si estaba mejorando.

Al escuchar esta canci√≥n me hace acordarme de el y de ese tan bonito momento que me gustar√≠a repetir m√°s de mil veces.

"Lyrics:
""Burn""

We, we don't have to worry 'bout nothing
'Cause we got the fire, and we're burning one hell of a something
They, they gonna see us from outer space, outer space
Light it up, like we're the stars of the human race, human race

When the light started out they don‚Äôt know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

We don't wanna leave, no. We just wanna be right now (right), r-r-right now
And what we see is everybody's on the floor acting crazy, getting loco 'til the lights out
Music's on, I'm waking up, we fight the fire, then we burn it up
And it's over now, we got the love, there's no sleeping now, no sleeping now, no sleeping

When the light started out they don‚Äôt know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

When the light started out they don‚Äôt know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world

We gonna let it burn burn burn burn (burn burn)
Burn burn burn burn (burn burn)

We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up

We, we don't have to worry 'bout nothin'
'Cause we got the fire, and we're burning one hell of a something
They, they gonna see us from outer space

When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky

We don't wanna leave, no, we just wanna be right now
And what we see, is everybody's on the floor
Acting crazy, getting loco to the lights out
Music's on, I'm waking up, we start the fire, and we burn it out
And it's over now, oh we got the love, there's no secret now
When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard

"Ba-Ba-Babylon girl, Ba-Ba-Babylon girl
Para todos aquellos amores que
Fueron obligados a ser separados
Ba-Ba-Babylon girl, Ba-Ba-Babylon girl
Esta canci√≥n es para ti

Dime c√≥mo le explico a mi destino que ya no est√°s ah√≠
Dime c√≥mo har√© para desprenderme de este frenes√≠
Esta locura que siento por ti
Con esta qu√≠mica que haces en m√≠
Ya no puedo, girl, ya no puedo, girl

Nena, disc√∫lpame
Y si te ilusion√©, yo no lo quise hacer
S√© que en el amor cuando es real
Ese vuelve, vuelve (vuelve, vuelve, vuelve)
Pero ¬øc√≥mo olvidar tu piel?
¬øY c√≥mo olvidarte, mujer?
Ya no puedo, girl, ya no puedo, girl

Baby, no (baby, no)
Me reh√∫so a darte un √∫ltimo beso
As√≠ que gu√°rdalo (gu√°rdalo)
Para que la pr√≥xima vez
Te lo d√© haci√©ndolo (haci√©ndolo)
Haci√©ndotelo as√≠, as√≠, as√≠
As√≠ como te gusta, baby

Sin mirar atr√°s, sin buscar a nadie m√°s
Solo quiero estar contigo, uoh
Si no te tengo aqu√≠ conmigo, ya no quiero ser tu amigo
Porque t√∫ eres mi camino, uoh

Y yo solo quiero estar junto a ti
Nena, por favor, enti√©ndelo
Solo dame tu mano y conf√≠a en m√≠
Si te pierdes, solo sigue mi voz

Y dale tiempo (tiempo), mami, al tiempo
Que t√∫, que yo, estamos hechos para estar los dos
Y dale tiempo (dale tiempo), baby, al tiempo
Que t√∫ y yo, que t√∫ y yo estamos hechos para estar los dos

Baby, no (baby, no)
Me reh√∫so a darte un √∫ltimo beso
As√≠ que gu√°rdalo (gu√°rdalo)
Para que la pr√≥xima vez
Te lo d√© haci√©ndolo (haci√©ndolo)
Haci√©ndotelo as√≠, as√≠, as√≠ (as√≠, as√≠)
As√≠ como te gusta, baby

Baby, no (baby, no)
Me reh√∫so a darte un √∫ltimo beso
As√≠ que gu√°rdalo (gu√°rdalo)
Para que la pr√≥xima vez
Te lo d√© haci√©ndolo
Haci√©ndotelo as√≠, as√≠, as√≠
As√≠ como te gusta, baby

As√≠, as√≠, as√≠ como te gusta, baby

Baby, no (baby, no)
Me reh√∫so a darte un √∫ltimo beso

"Letra:
Nada voy a hacer 
Rebuscando en las heridas del pasado 
No voy a perder 
Yo no quiero ser un tipo de otro lado
A tu manera, descomplicado 
En una bici que te lleve a todos lados 
Un vallenato desesperado 
Una cartica que yo guardo donde te escrib√≠ 
Que te sue√±o y que te quiero tanto 
Que hace rato est√° mi coraz√≥n 
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti 
La que yo guardo donde te escrib√≠ 
Que te sue√±o y que te quiero tanto 
Que hace rato est√° mi coraz√≥n 
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti
Puedo ser feliz 
Caminando relajada entre la gente 
Yo te quiero as√≠ 
Y me gustas porque eres diferente
A mi manera, despelucado 
En una bici que me lleva a todos lados 
Un vallenato desesperado 
Una cartica que yo guardo donde te escrib√≠ 
Que te sue√±o y que te quiero tanto 
Que hace rato est√° mi coraz√≥n 
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti 
La que yo guardo donde te escrib√≠ 
Que te sue√±o y que te quiero tanto 
Que hace rato est√° mi coraz√≥n 
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti
Ella es la favorita, la que canta en la zona 
Se mueve en su cadera como un barco en las olas 
Tiene los pies descalzos como un ni√±o que adora 
Y sus cabellos largos son un sol que te antoja

"Nothing i will do
Nada voy a hacer

Digging into the wounds of the past
Rebuscando en las heridas del pasado

I'm not gonna lose
No voy a perder

I don't want to be a guy from the other side
Yo no quiero ser un tipo de otro lado

In your own way, uncomplicated
A tu manera, descomplicado

On a bike that takes you everywhere
En una bici que te lleve a todos lados

A desperate vallenato
Un vallenato desesperado

A letter that I keep where I wrote you
Una cartica que yo guardo donde te escrib√≠

That I dream of you and that I love you so much
Que te sue√±o y que te quiero tanto

My heart has been around for a long time
Que hace rato est√° mi coraz√≥n

Beating for you, beating for you
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti

The one that I keep where I wrote you
La que yo guardo donde te escrib√≠

That I dream of you and that I love you so much
Que te sue√±o y que te quiero tanto

My heart has been around for a long time
Que hace rato est√° mi coraz√≥n

Beating for you, beating for you
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti

I can be happy
Puedo ser feliz

Walking relaxed among the people
Caminando relajada entre la gente

I want you like that
Yo te quiero as√≠

And I like you because you are different
Y me gustas porque eres diferente

In my own way, shaggy
A mi manera, despelucado

On a bike that takes me everywhere
En una bici que me lleva a todos lados

A desperate vallenato
Un vallenato desesperado

A letter that I keep where I wrote you
Una cartica que yo guardo donde te escrib√≠

That I dream of you and that I love you so much
Que te sue√±o y que te quiero tanto

My heart has been around for a long time
Que hace rato est√° mi coraz√≥n

Beating for you, beating for you
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti

The one that I keep where I wrote you
La que yo guardo donde te escrib√≠

That I dream of you and that I love you so much
Que te sue√±o y que te quiero tanto

My heart has been around for a long time
Que hace rato est√° mi coraz√≥n

Beating for you, beating for you
Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti

She is the favorite, the one who sings in the area
Ella es la favorita, la que canta en la zona

Moves on your hip like a ship on the waves
Se mueve en su cadera como un barco en las olas

He has bare feet like a child who adores
Tiene los pies descalzos como un ni√±o que adora

And her long hair is a sun that you crave
Y sus cabellos largos son un sol que te antoja

He likes to be told that it is the girl, the lola
Le gusta que le digan que es la ni√±a, la lola

She likes to be seen when she dances alone
Le gusta que la miren cuando ella baila sola

He likes the house better, that the hours do not pass
Le gusta m√°s la casa, que no pasen las horas

He likes Barranquilla, he likes Barcelona
Le gusta Barranquilla, le gusta Barcelona

Take me, take me on your bike
Lleva, ll√©vame en tu bicicleta

Listen to me, Carlos, take me on your bike
√ìyeme, Carlos, ll√©vame en tu bicicleta

I want us to travel that area together
Quiero que recorramos juntos esa zona

From Santa Marta to La Arenosa
Desde Santa Marta hasta La Arenosa

Take me, take me on your bike
Lleva, ll√©vame en tu bicicleta

So that we play ball and rag there in Chancleta
Pa' que juguemos bola 'e trapo all√° en Chancleta

What if one day you show Pique the Tayrona
Que si a Pique alg√∫n d√≠a le muestras el Tayrona

Then you will not want to go to Barcelona
Despu√©s no querr√° irse pa' Barcelona

In my own way, uncomplicated
A mi manera, descomplicado

On a bike that takes me everywhere
En una bici que me lleva a todos lados

A desperate vallenato
Un vallenato desesperado

A letter that I keep where I wrote you
Una cartica que yo guardo donde te escrib√≠

That I dream of you and that I love you so much

Yes to Pique someday you will show him the Tayrona
Que s√≠ a Pique alg√∫n d√≠a le muestras el Tayrona

Then you will not want to go to Barcelona
Despu√©s no querr√° irse pa' Barcelona

Take me, take me on your bike

Be my woman, girl, I'mma

Be my woman, girl, I'll
Be your man
Yes I be your woman
Yes I be your baby
Yes I be whatever that you tell me when you ready
Yes I be your girl, forever your lady
You ain't never gotta worry, I'm down for you baby
Best believe that when you need that
I'll provide that you will always have it
I'll be on deck keep it in check
When you need that I'mma let you have it
You beatin' drum like dum di di dey
I love the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you calling my name

Let me be your air
Let me roam your body freely
No inhibition, no fear
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
What devotion? Are you?
How deep is your love?
Is it like nirvana?
Hit me harder, again
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
Pull me closer, again
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
Open up my eyes and
Tell me who I am
Let me in on all your secrets
No inhibition, no sin
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
What devotion? Are you?
How deep is your love?
Is it like nirvana?
Hit me harder, again
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
Pull me closer, again
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
So tell me how deep is your love, can it go deeper?
So tell me how deep is your love, can it go deep?
So tell me how deep is your love, can it go deeper?
So tell me how deep is your love, can it go deep?
(How deep is your love?)
So tell me how deep is your love, can it go deeper?
So tell me how deep is your love, can it go deep?
(How deep is your love?)
So tell me how deep is your love, can it go deeper?
(Pull me closer, again)
So tell me how deep is your love
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
So tell me how deep is your love, can it go deeper?

"SWhen she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep and dreamed of
Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach and the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly every tear a waterfall
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly

And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
And so lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, ""Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know the sun must set to rise""

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This could be para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This could be para-para-paradise

"Like from my point of view:
1.The kid probably had some superpowers that he didnt know of and had some problems at school and he accidentaly caused that chaos inside and fainted so the teachers got scared and decided to call the police thinking that he can harm them.
2. The kid had no idea what happened and obviously felt bad and when he saw the cop outside he rushed home to get away from everyone but there he was, on the TV, and he knew that police would be after him. Again, he probably felt really bad and very scared and decided to go away even further but then police and special forces chased him in the forest, so when they caught him, he didn't give up and he just let his feelings free and he knocked them down..
3.So the point of the video is that the kid is really strong like titanium and that he wont give up on himself no matter what happens: ""you shot me down, but I wont fall"" which is supposed to be an inspiration for people => no matter how much ups and downs you have in your life, you should never give up and you should keep fighting until u succeed.",2014-06-25T16:49:19Z,4276

T√∫ no sabes lo que estoy sufriendo
Esto te lo tengo que decir
Cu√©ntame
Tu despedida para m√≠ fue dura
Ser√° que √©l te llev√≥ a la luna
Y yo no supe hacerlo as√≠
Te estaba buscando
Por la calle gritando
Esto me est√° matando, oh no
Te estaba buscando
Por la calle gritando
Como un loco tomando, oh
Es que yo sin ti, y t√∫ sin m√≠
Dime qui√©n puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta
Es que yo sin ti, y t√∫ sin m√≠
Dime qui√©n puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta
Yo sin ti, no aguanto m√°s
Por eso vengo a decirte lo que siento
Estoy sufriendo en la soledad
Y aunque tu padre no aprob√≥ esta relaci√≥n
Yo sigo insistiendo a pedir perd√≥n
Lo √∫nico que importa est√° en tu coraz√≥n
Te estaba buscando
Por la calle gritando
Esto me est√° matando, oh no
Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Como un loco tomando oh
Es que yo sin ti, y t√∫ sin m√≠
Dime qui√©n puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta
Es que yo sin ti, y t√∫ sin m√≠
Dime qui√©n puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Eso no me gusta
Yo te jur√© a ti ese eterno amor
Y ahora otro te da calor
Cuando en las noches tienes fr√≠o oh oh, oh
Yo s√© que √©l te parece mejor
Pero yo estoy en tu coraz√≥n
Y por eso pido perd√≥n
Es que yo sin ti, y t√∫ sin m√≠
Dime qui√©n puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta
Es que yo sin ti, y t√∫ sin m√≠
Dime qui√©n puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
oh yeah, oh oh
Dicen que uno no sabe lo que tiene hasta que lo pierde pero
(Yo sin ti) Vale la pena luchar por lo que uno quiere
(No puedo vivir as√≠) Y hacer el intento
(No quiero vivir as√≠)

Lo puse con el traductor de Google, y pueden haber palabras cambiadas
song in English: I translated it with the translator so some words are changed:
ahhh
 tell me if it's true,
They told me that you are getting married, 
You don't know what I'm suffering and I have to tell you this,
 Tell me
 Your farewell to me was hard,
 Will it take you to the moon?
 And I don't know what to do without you 
I was looking for you,
 down the street screaming, This is killing me,
 oh no 
I was looking for you,
 down the street screaming,
 like crazy taking,
 ohhhhhh,
Is that I without you, and you without me, 
tell me who wants to be happy? 
I do not like this, 
I do not like this 
Is that I without you, and you without me,
 tell me who wants to be happy?
 I do not like this,
 I do not like this 
is that living without you, 
I can not take anymore, 
that's why i come to tell you how I feel,
 I'm suffering in this loneliness 
ohhh 
and although your father did not approve of this relationship, 
I keep insisting to ask for forgiveness, 
The only thing that matters is in your heart 
I was looking for you,
 down the street screaming,
 this is killing me, ohh 
I was looking for you,
 down the street screaming,
 like crazy drinking,
 ohhhh
is that I without you, and you without me,
 tell me who wants to be happy? 
I do not like this,
I do not like this
is that I without you, and you without me,
tell me who wants to be happy? 
I do not like this,
I don't like this, 
ahhh
I swore to you eternal love, And now another gives you heat, 
when the nights are cold,
 ohhh ohh,
I know who you think is best, but I am in your heart,
So I apologize
is that I without you, and you without me,
Tell me who wants to be happy?
 I do not like this,
 I do not like this, 
is that I without you, and you without me,
tell me who wants to be happy?
 I don't like this

Dime qu√© t√∫ vas a hacer
Mami tengo la inquietud
Si quieres sufrir con √©l
Eso lo decides t√∫
Que seas feliz con √©l
Yo no te contestar√©
S√© que me vas a llamar
Cuando me extra√±e tu piel
Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo s√© que t√∫ te sientes m√≠a
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que con √©l te sientes fr√≠a
Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo s√© que t√∫ te sientes m√≠a
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que √©l es una porquer√≠a
Esta la hice pa' √©l
Cuando la escuche, quiero estar ah√≠ para ver
Cuando se entere y sepa que soy due√±o de usted
Tal vez suene un poco mal lo s√© y no me luce
Todo es por usted
Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo s√© que t√∫ te sientes m√≠a
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que con √©l te sientes fr√≠a
Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo s√© que t√∫ te sientes m√≠a
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que √©l es una porquer√≠a
Te caliento m√°s, m√°s, m√°s
Te caliento m√°s, m√°s, m√°s
Te caliento m√°s, m√°s, m√°s
Te caliento m√°s, m√°s, m√°s
Te caliento m√°s
Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo s√© que t√∫ te sientes m√≠a
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que √©l es una porquer√≠a

"*Respecto al problema de fandoms La verdad es que no solo lo hacen con BTS y BLACKPINK, hace a√±os yo era fan de dos grupos y sucedi√≥ lo mismo, seguidores de otros grupos se hicieron pasar por fans de los grupos que me gustaban y entonces se tiraban hate y los verdaderos fans se la cre√≠an y comenzaba una ola de odio entre ambos. Adem√°s cabe recalcar que no solo son fans otros grupos los que arman todo eso, si no que tambi√©n son anti fans del Kpop, para ser precisa el KPOP en general, gente que no tiene nada que ver y desconocen la m√∫sica surcoreana. As√≠ que la √∫nica forma de detener esto es: No hacer caso, enserio gente, si una persona te insulta, no hagas nada, ya ver√°s el rid√≠culo que hace el otro al hablar solo. Responder un insulto es aceptar lo que dicen de ti. Solo agranda el problema. As√≠ que este problema con hacerse pasar por fans no es de ahora. Ya viene de tiempo.*

Espero que las Blinks o Armys que lean esto. Tomen conciencia de lo que causan al responder los insultos. Sea cual sea sus motivos o que tan fuerte se sienta el odio. S√© que hay muchas fans de  12 o 13 a√±os , Enserio son muy mal vistas o tildadas de inmaduras traten de llevar su fanatismo a un nivel de respeto y apoyo en sus grupos favoritos.

"Blackpink¬†(Hangul: Î∏îÎûôÌïëÌÅ¨; commonly stylized as¬†BLACKPINK¬†or¬†BLŒõ∆ÜKPI–òK) is a South Korean¬†girl group¬†formed by¬†YG Entertainment, consisting of members¬†Jisoo,¬†Jennie,¬†Ros√©, and¬†Lisa. The group debuted on August 8, 2016, with their single album¬†Square One, which spawned ""Whistle"", their first number-one song in South Korea, as well as ""Boombayah"", their first number-one hit on the¬†Billboard¬†World Digital Songs¬†chart. With the group's early commercial success, they were hailed as the New Artist of the Year at the 31st¬†Golden Disc Awards¬†and the 26th¬†Seoul Music Awards. As of 2019, Blackpink is the highest-charting female K-pop act on both Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard 200, peaking at number 41 with ""Kill This Love"", and peaking at number 24 with Kill This Love, respectively. They are also the first and only K-pop girl group to enter and top Billboard's Emerging Artists chart. They are also the first female K-pop group to have four number-one singles on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart. At the time of its release, ""Ddu-Du Ddu-Du"" was the most-viewed Korean music video in the first 24 hours on YouTube, and in January 2019, it became the most viewed music video by a K-pop group on the website. As of September 2019, Blackpink is the most-subscribed music group on YouTube.

BLACKPINK is the only Korean artist included in Rolling Stone‚Äôs list of ‚Äú10 Best Music Videos of 2018‚Äù!

The magazine recently published its annual list of the year‚Äôs top music videos. This year, BLACKPINK placed No. 8 with their hit track ‚ÄúDDU-DU DDU-DU.‚Äù

Rolling Stone praised the ‚ÄúDDU-DU DDU-DU‚Äù music video as ‚Äúa feat of bonkers, maximalist creativity‚Äù and compared the girl group‚Äôs use of their iconic tank in the music video to the one in Master P‚Äôs ‚ÄúMake ‚ÄòEm Say Uhh.‚Äù The publication also noted that director Seo Hyun Seung, who is responsible for many of YG‚Äôs most popular music videos, didn‚Äôt hesitate to add his spectacular touch to this music video as well.

The ‚ÄúDDU-DU DDU-DU‚Äù music video was recently named the fastest K-pop music video to reach 550 million views and is known for having the highest official 24 hour views ever for a K-pop music video. It also has second highest official 24 hour views among all music videos in YouTube history.

Other music videos to make the list include The Carters‚Äô (Jay-Z and Beyonc√©) ‚ÄúApeshit,‚Äù Childish Gambino‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Is America,‚Äù and Drake‚Äôs ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs Plan.‚Äù

Tonight
I just want to take you higher
Throw your hands up in the sky
Let's set this party off right

Players, put yo' pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all trying to do?
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Uh, look out!

Pop pop, it's show time (Show time)
Show time (Show time)
Guess who's back again?
Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
I bet they know soon as we walk in
(Showin' up)
Wearing Cuban links (ya)
Designer minks (ya)
Inglewood's finest shoes (Whoop, whoop)
Don't look too hard
Might hurt ya'self
Known to give the color red the blues

Ooh shit, I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket
(Keep up)
So many pretty girls around me and they waking up the rocket
(Keep up)
Why you mad? Fix ya face
Ain't my fault y'all be jocking
(Keep up)

Players only, come on
Put your pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all trying to do?
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Uh, look out!

Second verse for the hustlas (hustlas)
Gangstas (gangstas)
Bad bitches and ya ugly ass friends (Haha)
Can I preach? (Uh oh) Can I preach? (Uh oh)
I gotta show 'em how a pimp get it in
First, take your sip (sip), do your dip (dip)
Spend your money like money ain't shit (Whoop, whoop)
We too fresh
Got to blame it on Jesus
Hashtag blessed
They ain't ready for me

I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket
(Keep up)
So many pretty girls around me and they waking up the rocket
(Keep up)
Why you mad? Fix ya face
Ain't my fault y'all be jocking
(Keep up)

Players only, come on
Put your pinky rings up to the moon
Hey girls
What y'all trying to do?
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Uh, look out!

(Wooh)
Everywhere I go they be like
Ooh, so player ooh
Everywhere I go they be like
Ooh, so player ooh
Everywhere I go they be like
Ooh, so player ooh

Watch me break it down like (Uh)
24 karat, 24 karat magic
What's that sound?

Come on now

Don't fight the feeling

Qu√© ganas tengo de buscarte 
Y de volverte a besar 
Por m√°s que traten de alejarte 
Baby hoy conmigo t√∫ te vas
Yo solo quiero que conf√≠es en m√≠
Y seas valiente, beb√©
Esc√°pate conmigo esta noche, beb√© 
Te quiero comer, te va a encantar 
T√∫ sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien 
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar 
Beb√© no digas que no
Si solo somos t√∫ y yo 
Y se te eriza la piel
Cuando entramos en calor
Beb√© no digas que no
Si solo somos t√∫ y yo 
Y se te eriza la piel
Cuando entramos en calor
Mi super nova, la que una sonrisa me roba 
Tremenda loba, solo un beso y calienta la alcoba 
Se me pega y me soba, no se incomoda 
La baby es una pantera, yo soy su Casanova
Esc√°pate conmigo, donde no hayan testigos 
Si te preguntan, dile que soy tu mejor amigo 
Yo quiero un beso, tu quieres castigo 
Sabes que no te obligo, te deseo, siempre te lo digo (Mamita deja la ventana abierta)
Esc√°pate conmigo esta noche, beb√© 
Te quiero comer, te va a encantar 
T√∫ sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien 
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar
Es que yo quiero un poco m√°s, de tu rica desnudez 
Es que el sudor de tu piel, es el que yo quiero probar 
Es que yo quiero un poco m√°s, de tu rica desnudez 
Es que el sudor de tu piel, es el que yo quiero probar
Baby andamos con los poderes 
Ozuna
Mi mente descontrola 
Y si la llamo ella me dice que la busque que est√° sola 
Que no hay tiempo, pero haci√©ndolo se demora 
Si le fallo, que tranquilo por que no se enamora
Tranquila, la vida conmigo te lo vacilas 
Que no he visto otra baby, de tu liga 
Esos besitos que me dan ganas 
De amanecer contigo todas las ma√±anas
Esc√°pate conmigo esta noche, beb√© 
Te quiero comer, te va a encantar 
T√∫ sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien 
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar
Be√© no digas que no, si solo somos t√∫ y yo

volverte a besar por mas

y me soba nos incomoda
la baby es una guantera

yo quiero un beso tu quieres
castigo sabes que no te obligo
te deseo siempre te lo digo

la llamo ella me dice que la

I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showing
Hot night, wind was blowing
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad

It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad

"I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me I'll never tell
I looked at you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I'd trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going baby?

Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going baby?

Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so so bad
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so so bad

It's hard to look right at you baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so so bad
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that
So call me maybe",2020-09-02T14:41:26Z,23

I'd rather break up with someone before cheating, that is just something that will only hurt them more than a break up, if someone cheats on you she/he clearly doesn't love you back, and for me, that would be enough to just quit trying, because everyone deserves better than this.¬†",2014-11-18T22:35:15Z,2567

But I know that I still need you here

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

"I woke up around 6am with my man still asleep next to me. I took a phone from the table next to my bed thinking it was mine. Then I read the message on the notification saying, ""See you before lunch. I miss you baby. -unregistered number"". My heart sank realizing it was his phone. My hands started shaking but after a few minutes I started preparing and then went to work. By lunch time I decided to take the rest of the day off. I went home and saw an unfamiliar car leaving our parking space. I went into our apartment and found him cleaning up everything. He froze in shock seeing me. I came close and kissed his forehead and softly whispered to him, ""It's okay. I know I'm not the only one.""
That was the 3rd and final time I cared. I'm getting my life back together now. I'll be okay without him. üôÉ",2020-08-20T16:44:23Z,428

"Was with married for 10 years. Together for over 12 years. We have 3 beautiful kids. I cook, I clean, I take care of our kids, I have a good Job. Was able to buy our first house together. Everything seemed perfect but I always had my doubts. There were signs of infidelity but she kept telling me I was crazy and lied about everything. Just kept piling up the lies for about a year. I hated myself for having doubts on the woman i've been with for a third of my life. Came to the point I found enough evidence and I begged her to tell me the truth. She continued to lie but finally confessed. Being cheated on has been the hardest thing I've ever been through. It still hurts and even though I say I've moved on; I don't think I will ever be 100%. If you want to be with someone else please end your current relationship first. Cheating is not fun and it definitely isn't fair.

"I found out my wife cheated on me in July of 2019. The divorce was officially settled in September. We had been married since 2007 and had known each other since 9th grade. I had suspicions that she had been cheating on me,  but she constantly told me I was being insecure or worrying for no reason. I went along with it for a while, but something didn‚Äôt feel right. She was coming home late, she didn‚Äôt show me the same level of affection, would never let me see her phone, and she was always ‚Äúbusy.‚Äù She‚Äôd been cheating on me since 2015, but I let my love and trust for her blind me. She took advantage of me and my kindness. The pain I felt listening to this song and the way I was able to relate to it made me cry more than I ever have in my life, and that crying made me feel better than I ever have. The morale of the story here is: 1) Never let people take advantage of your kindness 2) make sure you choose the right person when you are looking for a relationship, what I mean is make sure both of you are on the same page. When one person in the relationship is more loving and affectionate than the other, the relationship is doomed from the start, and 3) it‚Äôs ok to cry, it feels amazing. 

Take care and have an amazing 2020.",2020-01-07T00:57:35Z,11719

Barbie's on the barbecue

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled, damn

Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a m√©nage √† trois
Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
Oh whoa

This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credits card
And got kicked out of the bar

We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a m√©nage √† trois

"Lyrics: 
 I thought that I've been hurt before

But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
I'm tripping over myself
Aching begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
I'm tripping over myself
Aching begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Needle and the thread
Gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread
Gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread
Gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread
Gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread
Gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread
Gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread
Gotta get you out of my head, get you out of my head
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking falling onto my knees (falling on my knees)
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches (and I'll be needing stitches)
I'm tripping over myself
Aching begging you to come help (begging baby please)
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches",2020-08-28T19:13:35Z,331

"I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Needle and the thread
Gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread
Gonna wind up dead

Needle in the thread
Gotta get you out of my head, get you out of my head

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees (falling on my knees)
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches (and I'll be needing stitches)
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help (begging, ""Baby, please."")

"Lyrics: 

 I thought that I've been hurt before

But no one's ever left me quite this sore

Your words cut deeper than a knife

Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under

But I know that I'll make it out alive

If I quit calling you my lover

Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe

I'm shaking falling onto my knees

And now that I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches

I'm tripping over myself

Aching begging you to come help

And now that I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame

Oh you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain

Your bitter heart cold to the touch

Now I'm gonna reap what I sow

I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under

But I know that I'll make it out alive

If I quit calling you my lover

Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe

I'm shaking falling onto my knees

And now that I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches

I'm tripping over myself

Aching begging you to come help

And now that I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches

Needle and the thread

Gotta get you out of my head

Needle and the thread

Gonna wind up dead

Needle and the thread

Gotta get you out of my head

Needle and the thread

Gonna wind up dead

Needle and the thread

Gotta get you out of my head

Needle and the thread

Gonna wind up dead

Needle and the thread

Gotta get you out of my head, get you out of my head

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe

I'm shaking falling onto my knees (falling on my knees)

And now that I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches (and I'll be needing stitches)

I'm tripping over myself

Aching begging you to come help (begging baby please)

And now that I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches

And now that I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches

And now that I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches

"Lyrics:



S√∫beme la radio
Tr√°-tr√°eme el alcohol

S√∫beme la radio que esta es mi canci√≥n
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tr√°eme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol

S√∫beme la radio que esta es mi canci√≥n
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tr√°eme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol

Ya no me importa nada
Ni el d√≠a, ni la hora
Si lo he perdido todo
Me has dejado en las sombras

Te juro que te pienso
Hago el mejor intento
El tiempo pasa lento
Y yo me voy muriendo
(Y yo me voy muriendo)

Si llega la noche y t√∫ no contestas
Te juro, me quedo esperando a tu puerta
Vivo pasando las noches en vela
Y sigo cantando bajo la luna llena

S√∫beme la radio que esta es mi canci√≥n
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tr√°eme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol

S√∫beme la radio que esta es mi canci√≥n
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tr√°eme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol

Huyendo del pasado
En cada madrugada
No encuentro ning√∫n modo
De borrar nuestra historia

A su salud bebiendo
(A su salud bebiendo)
Mientras me quede aliento
(Mientras me quede aliento)
Solo le estoy pidiendo
(Solo te estoy pidiendo)
Romper este silencio
(Romper este silencio)

S√∫beme la radio que esta es mi canci√≥n
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tr√°eme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol

S√∫beme la radio que esta es mi canci√≥n
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tr√°eme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol

Ando loco y desesperado en busca de tu amor
No me dejes en esta soledad, te pido
Nena te digo, vuelve conmigo
Si t√∫ me llamas, te juro que pa' all√° voy yo

Quiero verte ya, ya no aguanto m√°s
Quiero darte calor solo una vez m√°s
Ya no aguanto m√°s, quiero verte ya, hoy

Yo no te miento
Todav√≠a te espero
Sabes bien que te quiero
No s√© vivir sin ti

Yo no te miento
Todav√≠a te espero
Sabes bien que te quiero
No s√© vivir sin ti

S√∫beme la radio que esta es mi canci√≥n
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tr√°eme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol

S√∫beme la radio que esta es mi canci√≥n
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tr√°eme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol

"Turn up the radio
Bri-bring me the alcohol
 
Turn up the radio that this is my song
Feel the bass that goes up
 
Bring me the alcohol that takes away the pain
Today we gonna join the moon and the sun
 
Turn up the radio that this is my song
Feel the bass that goes up
Bring me the alcohol that takes away the pain
Today we gonna join the moon and the sun
 
I don't care anymore
Neither the day nor the hour
If I've lost everything
You left me in the shadows
 
I swear I think you
I make the best attempt
Time goes slow
And I'm gonna die
(And I'm gonna die)
 
If the night comes and you don't answer
I swear I keep waiting at your door
I live on sleepless nights
And I keep singing under the full moon
 
Turn up the radio that this is my song
Feel the bass that goes up
 
Bring me the alcohol that takes away the pain
Today we gonna join the moon and the sun
 
Turn up the radio that this is my song
Feel the bass that goes up
Bring me the alcohol that takes away the pain
Today we gonna join the moon and the sun
 
Fleeing the past
Every morning
I can't find any way
To erase our history
To your health by drinking
(To your health by drinking)
As long as I breathe
(As long as I breathe)
I'm just asking you
(I'm just asking you)
Break this silence
(Break this silence)
 
Turn up the radio that this is my song
Feel the bass that goes up
 
Bring me the alcohol that takes away the pain
Today we gonna join the moon and the sun
 
Turn up the radio that this is my song
Feel the bass that goes up
Bring me the alcohol that takes away the pain
Today we gonna join the moon and the sun
 
I'm crazy and desperate in search of your love
Don't leave me in this loneliness I beg you
I really tell you, go back with me
If you call me, I swear we dance
 
And I want to see you now
I can't stand it any more
I want to give you heat
Just one more time
I can't stand it any more
I want to see you now, ohhh
 
I don't lie to you
I still wait for you
You know I love you
I don't know how to live without you
 
I don't lie to you
I still wait for you
You know I love you
I don't know how to live without you

I fly so high, no ceiling
When I'm in my zone

Cause i got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good sole in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it 
Moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it 
So don't stop

[Pre-Chorus]
And under the lights 
When everything goes
Nowhere to hide, when I'm getting you close
When we move, well you already know
So just imagine (just imagine, just imagine)

[Chorus]
Nothin' i can see but you, when you dance, dance, dance
Feel a good, good creepin' up on you, so just dance, dance, dance
Come on
All those things i shouldn't do, but you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancin'

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling 
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling 
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling 
So keep dancin'

[Bridge]
(Oh yeah yeah)
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the, I can't stop the 
I can't stop the feeling 

[Chorus]
Nothin' i can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feel a good, good creepin' up on you, so just dance, dance, dance
All those things i shouldn't do but you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancin'

I can't stop the feeling 
Got this feeling in my body
I can't stop the feeling 
Got this feeling in my body
I can't stop the feeling 
Wanna see you move your body
I can't stop the feeling
Got this feeling in my body

Break it down
Got this feeling in my body 
Can't stop the feeling 
Got this feeling in my body 
Can't stop the feeling 
Got this feeling in my body
Come on, oooh",2020-09-06T20:01:16Z,2

"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""

Baby, you're a firework

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

Come on, show 'em what you're worth

Mm-mmm
Yeah, yeah
Mm-mmm
Yeah (Hey)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, ""Congratulations"" (Uh, uh, uh)
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation (Uh-huh)
They ain't never had the dedication (Uh, uh)
People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it (Uh, uh)
Yeah, we made it (Uh, uh, uh)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
They was never friendly, yeah
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
But I know I had to have it, yeah
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I be itching like a addict, yeah
I'm surrounded, twenty bad bitches, yeah
But they didn't know me last year, yeah
Everyone wanna act like they important (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dough, yuh (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Everyone countin' on me, drop the ball, yuh (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Everything custom like I'm at the border, yeah, yeah
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky
How could I make cents when I got millions on my mind?
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes
Chorus: Post Malone & Quavo]
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, ""Congratulations"" (Congratulations)
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation (Ooh)
They ain't never had the dedication (Uh, uh, ayy)
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it (Uh, uh)
Yeah, we made it (Uh, uh, uh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I was patient (Yeah, oh)
I was patient (Ayy, ooh)
Now I can scream that we made it (We made it!)
Now everywhere, everywhere I go, they say 'gratulation (Ooh)
Young nigga, young nigga, graduation (Yeah)
I pick up the rock and I ball, baby (Ball)
I'm looking for someone to call, baby (Brr)
But right now, I got a situation (Ayy)
Never old Ben-Ben Franklins (Cash)
Big rings (Ooh), champagne (Champagne)
My life is like a ball game (Ball game)
But instead, I'm in the trap though (Trap though)
Pot so big, call it Super Bowl (Super Bowl)
Super Bowl, call the hoes (Brr), get in the Rolls (Skrrt)
Top-floor lifestyle (Top), Huncho and Post (Yeah, ayy)
Malone (Ayy), I gotta play on my phone (Ayy)
You know what I'm on (Ayy), Huncho Houdini is gone (Ayy)
Chorus: Post Malone & Quavo]
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young

"LYRICS
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
This biggity boy's a diggity dog
I have 'em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off
Twerking in their bras and thongs, timber
Face down, booty up, timber
That's the way we like the what, timber
I'm slicker than an oil spill
She say she won't, but I bet she will, timber
Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down

"Baby
Chris Jeday (Chris Jeday)
Austin baby
J Balvin man
Ozuna baby, (Ozuna)

No quiere saber na' de m√≠
Ay, dime qu√© fue lo que yo hice mal
Te pusieron en contra de m√≠
Al que fue, no se lo voy a perdonar

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue
Yo si me acuerdo c√≥mo lo hac√≠amos
C√≥mo en la cama nos mat√°bamos (Let go, come on)

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue
Yo s√≠ me acuerdo c√≥mo lo hac√≠amos
C√≥mo en la cama nos mat√°bamos

S√© que te pasas negando, todo lo que t√∫ y yo hac√≠amos
Queda en tu mente grabado todas las veces que nos desvest√≠amos
Ahora me paso pensando, c√≥mo t√∫ puedes vivir as√≠
Diciendo que no sabes lo que entre s√°banas t√∫ te entregaba a m√≠

Solo yo, he podido llegarle
Tu cuerpo sabe elevarse
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban
No dec√≠a nada ya no

Dialogando con el dinero
No quiero interrupciones
Esa es la prioridad
Pasaste lista de opciones
Estoy con la colombiana, que sepa ma√±ana y la cubana llega a Paris
Ll√°mate al ruso, que baje los kilos de oro que llegan a la calle de Brasil

Solo yo he podido llegarle
Tu cuerpo sabe, elevarse
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban
No dec√≠a nada, nada no no

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue
Yo s√≠ me acuerdo c√≥mo lo hac√≠amos
C√≥mo en la cama nos mat√°bamos

Y ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no
Y si me ha visto se supone, que en el pasado fue
Yo s√≠ me acuerdo c√≥mo lo, hac√≠amos
Cuando en la cama nos mat√°bamos (J Balvin man)

Por m√°s que me niegues a m√≠, no puedes escaparte
Si era tu luz de mi sombra y me segu√≠as a todas partes
Nos lograron separar, t√∫ no quisiste escuchar
Fue m√°s importante qu√© dijo la gente, que a d√≥nde pod√≠amos llegar

En el mundo de m√≠ est√°n hablando
Diciendo mil cosas
Que me ven por aqu√≠, que me ven por all√°
Por mi vida famosa
T√∫ me conoces de a√±os atr√°s, sabes c√≥mo es la cosa
T√∫ sabes que yo soy real
Te lo dije una vez

Y s√© que nuestro amor es peri√≥dico de ayer
Que t√∫ no lo quieres leer, que ni por la calle t√∫ me quieres ver
Si sales de party me escuchas a m√≠, siempre te preguntan por m√≠ baby
Dime qu√© se siente ser el fantasma que te atormenta a ti

Dime que pas√≥ mami, todo iba normal
Te hablaron de m√≠, te dejastes llevar
Tu cuerpo me estaba empezando a amar
Y por culpa de la gente, ahora te toca olvidar

Yo s√© que eres infeliz, pero te pasas mintiendo
Fingiendo que eres feliz, mami yo no te entiendo
Ahora √©l te pone a llorar, tambi√©n te pone a sufrir
Mientras yo te pon√≠a a viajar, yo linda te hac√≠a lucir

Solo yo he podido llegarle
Tu cuerpo sabe elevarse
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban
No me dec√≠a nada nada no no

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue
Yo s√≠ me acuerdo c√≥mo lo hac√≠amos
C√≥mo en la cama nos mat√°bamos

Y ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue
Yo s√≠ me acuerdo c√≥mo lo hac√≠amos
C√≥mo en la cama nos mat√°bamos

"Right from the start
You were a thief
You stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them

Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everythin'
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah, but this is happenin')

You've been havin' real bad dreams, oh, oh
You used to lie so close to me, oh, oh
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
Oh, our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
I never stopped
You're still written in the scars on my heart
You're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh, tear ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust
But our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Your head is running wild again

Oh our love, our love
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent and we can learn to love again
I never stop, you're still written in the scars on my heart
You're not broken just bent and we can learn to love again

Oh tear ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust, but our love's enough
You're holding it in

My dad wouldn't sing at first but he'll eventually sing along. i really miss those days.. back when my sis and i would play on the streets with other kids from the neighborhood, back when i still had friends who'd stick with me through thick and thin; and we would ask our moms if we could hang out in the mall after school. i know that all those days are over and now we're pretty much stuck in our homes.. (don't get me wrong, being safe from the virus is a good thing) but we have to move on. we need to take care of what's happening in the present and pray and hope for a better tomorrow. i hope everyone is safe in quarantine. i wish the best for everyone~ !! <3",2020-08-06T10:59:21Z,50

Sam Smith goes down in history as the most popular male vocalist of the '010s decade... I'd be honored if some Sam Smith fans who appreciate 80s/90s classics would take a listen to my acoustic piano & vocal YT performances of PURPLE RAIN by Prince and PRAYING FOR TIME by George Michael in tribute to 2 of the greatest vocalist-songwriters of all time. Live acoustic with no autotune. Peace and stay safe in the '020s.,2020-09-06T18:00:21Z,61

"French lyrics :
Tu dois penser que je suis stupide
Tu dois penser que je suis un imb√©cile
Tu dois penser que je suis novice en la mati√®re
Mais j'ai d√©j√† connu √ßa auparavant


Je ne te laisserai jamais te rapprocher de moi
M√™me si tu comptes le plus pour moi
Parce que chaque fois que je m'ouvre, je souffre
Alors, je ne deviendrai jamais trop proche de toi
M√™me quand je compte le plus pour toi
Au cas o√π tu partirais en me laissant seule dans ma boue

Je pleure moins chaque fois que tu me blesses
Mes larmes s√®chent plus vite chaque fois que tu me laisses
Et je t'aime de moins chaque fois que tu me quittes
B√©b√©, nous n'avons aucune chance ; c'est vrai et c'est triste

Je suis bien trop dou√© pour les adieux
(Je suis bien trop dou√© pour les adieux)


Je suis bien trop dou√© pour les adieux
(Je suis bien trop dou√© pour les adieux)

Je sais que tu penses que je suis cruel
Je sais que tu crois que je suis froid
Je prot√®ge juste mon innocence
Je prot√®ge simplement mon √¢me

Je ne te laisserai jamais te rapprocher de moi
M√™me si tu comptes le plus pour moi
Parce que chaque fois que je m'ouvre, je souffre
Alors, je ne deviendrai jamais trop proche de toi
M√™me quand je compte le plus pour toi
Au cas o√π tu partirais en me laissant seule dans ma boue

Je pleure moins chaque fois que tu me blesses
Mes larmes s√®chent plus vite chaque fois que tu me laisses


Et je t'aime moins chaque fois que tu me quittes
B√©b√©, nous n'avons aucune chance ; c'est vrai et c'est triste

Je suis bien trop dou√© pour les adieux
(Je suis bien trop dou√© pour les adieux)
Je suis bien trop dou√© pour les adieux
(Je suis bien trop dou√© pour les adieux)

Hors de question que tu me voies pleurer
(Hors de question que tu me voies pleurer)
Hors de question que tu me voies pleurer
(Hors de question que tu me voies pleurer)
Non
Non, non, non, non, non
(Je suis bien trop dou√© pour les adieux)
Non, non, non, non
Non, non, non


(Je suis bien trop dou√© pour les adieux)
(Hors de question que tu me voies pleurer)

Car je pleure moins chaque fois que tu me blesses
Mes larmes s√®chent plus vite chaque fois que tu me laisses
Et je t'aime moins chaque fois que tu me quittes
B√©b√©, nous n'avons aucune chance ; c'est vrai et c'est triste

You must think that I‚Äôm stupid
You must think that I‚Äôm a fool
You must think that I‚Äôm new to this
But I have seen this all before

I‚Äôm never going to let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up it hurts
So I‚Äôm never going to get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby we don‚Äôt stand a chance, it‚Äôs sad but it‚Äôs true
I‚Äôm way too good at goodbyes (I‚Äôm way too good at goodbyes)
I‚Äôm way too good at goodbyes (I‚Äôm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you‚Äôll see me cry (No way that you‚Äôll see me cry)
I‚Äôm way too good at goodbyes (I‚Äôm way too good at goodbyes)

I know you‚Äôre thinking I‚Äôm heartless
I know you‚Äôre thinking I‚Äôm cold
I‚Äôm just protecting my innocence
I‚Äôm just protecting my soul

I‚Äôm never going to let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
‚ÄòCause every time I open up it hurts
So I‚Äôm never going to get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby we don‚Äôt stand a chance, it‚Äôs sad but it‚Äôs true
I‚Äôm way too good at goodbyes (I‚Äôm way too good at goodbyes)
I‚Äôm way too good at goodbyes (I‚Äôm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you‚Äôll see me cry (No way that you‚Äôll see me cry)
I‚Äôm way too good at goodbyes (I‚Äôm way too good at goodbyes)

No‚Ä¶
(I‚Äôm way too good at goodbyes)
(I‚Äôm way too good at goodbyes)
(No way that you‚Äôll see me cry)
Oh‚Ä¶

"BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY SONGTEXT

Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landside
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see

I'm just a poor boy (Poor boy)
I need no sympathy
Because Im easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Any way the wind blows
Doesnt really matter to me
To me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away


Mama, ooh, ooh, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If Im not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
As if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave it all behind and face the truth

Mama, ooh, ooh, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, Scaramouch will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
Galileo (Galileo) Galileo (Galileo)
Galileo, Figaro (Magnifico)

I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah, no, we will not let you go (Let him go)
Bismillah, we will not let you go (Let him go)
Bismillah, we will not let you go (Let me go)
Will not let you go (Let me go)
Will not let you go, let me go
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia
Mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside
For me, for me, for me

So you think you can stop me and spit my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here

Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Any way the wind blows",2020-09-05T20:19:51Z,20

The diference between a dog and snake talking is when 1 starts never stops , no pause , no inbetween , no nothing , it is just bark , no inner capacity to realize and snakes is more like they only interrupt , do not have much to say or always the same but when some1 says anything they just topple over on the same moment . They have no build up , from it is the only way to uproot game . They speak of patience for when stealthing around but it is much about the on going action instead where comprehension is formulated like the 1st video , 1 understands the situation , probably the last thing they do . It is neither and defence too aids on nothing . It is only preventive . 1 makes whatever was those timestamps that still may not always be at 1 ' s favour , as such is seen in wrestling talking of build ups or lost title matches according to falls and then is actually who comes back for another match .

Vestido, de traje, lujuria salvaje bajo mi piel
Si dios, puso la manzana fue para morder
Ay dios, pequemo' abrazaditos hasta el amanecer

Llego la fiesta, pa' tu boquita
Toda la noche, todito el dia
Vamo' a ba√±arnos en la orillita
Que la marea esta picadita-ita-ita

Bocado crujiente, rico pastel
Fuego en tus pupilas, tu cuerpo destila tequila y miel

Me parece natural, letal, as√≠ te pones a bailar
No te pones freno cuando te pones a sudar
Vamo' a lo low, para sentir tu flow
Pa ense√±arte ni√±a, pa llamar la atenci√≥n
Te mantiene en tensi√≥n, sin bajar la presi√≥n
El sudor tiene cura pa frenar la tensi√≥n

Deja de moderte, estoy vampiro bien demente
Deja de moderte, te lo juro y si la gente
Deja de moderte, bien despacito y b√∫scame
Deja de moderte, amarradito bien demente

"Lyricsüéß

You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make-up to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful
So co-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why, you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eye-eye-eyes
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful
Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
(You don't know, oh oh)
You don't know you're beautiful
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh

You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make-up to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough

Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful

So co-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why, you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eye-eye-eyes
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful

Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
(You don't know, oh oh)
You don't know you're beautiful

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh

Needless to say, I keep in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (Yeah)
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (Wreck)
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (Wreck)
Needless to say, I'm keeping in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose

Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're a sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Every time I'm leavin' on ya (Ooh)
You don't make it easy, no (No, no)
Wish I could be there for ya (Ooh)
Give me a reason to, oh (Oh)
Every time I'm walkin' out (Oh)
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around (Oh, oh)
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down (No)
Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (Now)
I know you're scared of the unknown (Known)
You don't wanna be alone (Alone)
I know I always come and go (And go)
But it's out of my control

[Chorus: Post Malone]
And you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya

I remember one time I was in a bit of an argument with my S.O and it was a big one, which does not happen often. I was driving her home, and this song came over my Playlist. By the time I drove in the lane way, and the song had faded out, we were both teared up, and we just hugged for like 20 minutes.

[Intro: Swae Lee]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (Ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh)
Ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Needless to say, I keep in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (Yeah)
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (Wreck)
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (Wreck)
Needless to say, I'm keeping in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're a sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Every time I'm leavin' on ya (Ooh)
You don't make it easy, no (No, no)
Wish I could be there for ya (Ooh)
Give me a reason to, oh (Oh)
Every time I'm walkin' out (Oh)
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around (Oh, oh)
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down (No)
Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (Now)
I know you're scared of the unknown (Known)
You don't wanna be alone (Alone)
I know I always come and go (And go)
But it's out of my control

[Chorus: Post Malone]
And you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower (Yeah)",2020-09-06T19:07:42Z,51

"To the 1% that read this:
Your skin isn‚Äôt paper, don‚Äôt cut it.
Your face isn‚Äôt a mask, don‚Äôt hide it.
Your body isn‚Äôt a book, don‚Äôt judge it.
Your heart isn‚Äôt a door, don‚Äôt lock it.
Your life isn‚Äôt a movie, don‚Äôt end it.

You are you, and you‚Äôre beautiful the way you are.  There are at least 2 people in this world that would sacrifice themselves for your living. 

Be proud of yourself, be you. Express your feeling and show that you are great, because you certainly are. 

Study hard, push yourself, and you will achieve your goals. Keep fit, eat healthy and keep hygiene. We can get through COVID-19 together!

And if you are that awesome that you read the whole paragraph, I am a young music creator trying to make a change! And it's my dream to help people's lives with my music! <3

"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told you
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some
Breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars
For that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you 'til
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

"There was a blind girl who hated herself just because she was blind. She hated everyone, except her loving boyfriend. He was always there for her. She said that if she could only see the world, she would marry her boyfriend.

One day, someone donated a pair of eyes to her and then she could see everything, including her boyfriend. Her boyfriend asked her, ‚ÄúNow that you can see the world, will you marry me?‚Äù

The girl was shocked when she saw that her boyfriend was blind too, and refused to marry him. Her boyfriend walked away in tears, and later wrote a letter to her saying: ‚ÄúJust take care of my eyes dear.‚Äù

I need you, I need you the...
I need you the most

I gave you the key when the door wasn't open
Just admit it
See, I gave you faith
Turned your doubt into hoping
Can't deny it
Now I'm all alone
And my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you?

Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need you?
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down I didn't leave you
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?

Where are you now that I need you?

I gave you attention when nobody else was paying
I gave you the shirt off my back
-What you saying?-
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playing
That's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying
Oh Lord

Where are you now that I need you?
I need you...
I need you the most

"I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was seeing !! It‚Äôs an incredible revelation a massive cry for help !! Do not shrug this off as conspiracy theory I think Justin Bieber is in Extreme Trouble and is a Slave to the very dark reality of Hollywood! 

The dark truth about Hollywood is hidden in plain sight on purpose and deliberately being put in a conspiracy theorist box so that we can look ridiculous if we mention it but the story laid out in this video which you can only catch in very slow motion is extreme and full of really strong claims !! 

I‚Äôve watched the ridiculous long witted extra far out Illuminati , Area 51, reptilian shape shifters garbage which I‚Äôm certain is intentionally extra ridiculous to put every real thing in this same box of ridiculous because if you talk about some of it you talk about all of it and now you are that guy but this is not that !! This video is incredibly disturbing !!

"Reasons you should stay

1. We would miss you. 
2. It's not worth the regret. Either by yourself if you failed or just simply left scars, or the regret everyone else feels by not doing enough to help you. 
3. It does get better. Believe it or not it will eventually get better. Sometimes you have to go through the storm to get to the rainbow. 
4. There's so much you would miss out on doing. 
5. There is always a reason to live. It might not be clear right now, but it is always there. 
6. So many people care, and it would hurt them if you hurt yourself. 
7. You ARE worth it. Don't let anyone, especially yourself, tell you otherwise. 
8. You are amazing. 
9. A time will come, once you've battled the toughest times of your life and are in ease once again, where you will be so glad that you decided to keep on living. You will emerge stronger from this all, and won't regret your choice to carry on with life. Because things always get better. 
10. What about all the things you've always wanted to do? What about the things you've planned, but never got around to doing? You can't do them when you're dead. 
11. I love you. Even if only one person loves you, that's still a reason to stay alive. 
12. You won't be able to listen to music if you die.

"I'm only human
I'm only, I'm only
I'm only human, human

Maybe I'm foolish
Maybe I'm blind
Thinking I can see through this
And see what's behind
Got no way to prove it
So maybe I'm blind
But I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

Take a look in the mirror
And what do you see
Do you see it clearer
Or are you deceived
In what you believe
'Cause I'm only human after all
You're only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

Some people got the real problems
Some people out of luck
Some people think I can solve them
Lord heavens above
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

Don't ask my opinion
Don't ask me to lie
Then beg for forgiveness
For making you cry
Making you cry
'Cause I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

Oh, some people got the real problems
Some people out of luck
Some people think I can solve them
Lord heavens above
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

I'm only human
I make mistakes
I'm only human
That's all it takes
To put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

I'm no prophet or Messiah
Should go looking somewhere higher
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

I'm only human
I do what I can
I'm just a man
I do what I can
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me",2020-09-06T12:17:01Z,16

It's not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me, I know

I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Ooh, was she tipsy?
I had enough convo for 24
I peeped you from across the room
A pretty little body, dancing like GoGo, aye

And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Oooh, why not?
A fucking good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl then I'm so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage

Oh, oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

Feelin' like I'm fresh out, Boosie
If they want the drama, got the Uzi
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship
Doin' shit you don't even see in movies
Ride with me, ride with me, boss
I got a hard head but her ass soft
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million cash, told her plank on it

And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose?
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi

It's not good enough for me
Since I been with you, ooh

I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Ooh, was she tipsy?
I had enough convo for 24
I peeped you from across the room
A pretty little body, dancing like GoGo, aye

And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Oooh, why not?
A fucking good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl then I'm so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage

Oh, oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

Oh, oh, you ain't enough for me
Too much for you alone
Baby, go and grab some bad bitches
Bring 'em home
Know the jet's on me
I'mma curve my best for you, you know
So pick up that dress for me
Leave the rest home

Too much combo 24 hours
When you stand next to 24 karats
She left her man at home
She don't love him no more
I want your mind and your body
Don't mind nobody
So as long you don't never hurt nobody
Baby girl, work your body, work your body

And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose? (Oooh)
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi (Why not?)

Oh, oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do",2020-09-03T23:05:51Z,15

La la la la la
I dare you!
All of my life, too late
To you showed out with perfect timing
Now, here we are, you rock it
Our fingers are stuck in the socket
It's just a mature, a game
Get ready, we'll do it again
Let's not recover from the hangover
When your eyes got me drunk I was sober
Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare on the dance floor
La la la la la
Truth or dare on the dance floor
La la la la la oh, oh, oh, oh
I dare you
Of all the millions, on the planet
You're the one is keeping me on it
You know I like you, and nobody's business
And your are my witness
It's just a mature, a game
Get ready, we'll do it again
Let's not recover from the hangover
When your eyes got me drunk I was sober
Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare on the dance floor
La la la la la
Truth or dare on the dance floor
La la la la la oh, oh, oh, oh

Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me

All of my life, too late
To you showed out with perfect timing
Now, here we are, you rock it
Our fingers are stuck in the socket
It's just a mature, a game
Get ready, we'll do it again

When your eyes got me drunk I was sober
Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare on the dance floor

You're the one is keeping me on it
You know I like you, and nobody's business
And your are my witness
It's just a mature, a game
Get ready, we'll do it again
Let's not recover from the hangover
When your eyes got me drunk I was sober
Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare on the dance floor
La la la la la
Truth or dare on the dance floor

Load up on guns, bring your friends

I feel stupid and contagious

And for this gift I feel blessed

"We're talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, ok?

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is ok
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Oh, things that you say
Is it a life or just to play my worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day",2020-09-05T19:44:29Z,37

"LYRICS
And another one bites the dust
But why can I not conquer love?
And I might've thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I want it and I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah let's be clear, I trust no one
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace
Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah I may snap and I move fast
You won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart
And I will stay up through the night
Yeah let's be clear, I won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I walked through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
And I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace
Oh, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp

My bf has a high conflict ex who uses their daughter against him. He‚Äôs always fighting for his daughter. The cage is what he‚Äôs trapped in trying to coparent with his ex, to get to his daughter. He just wants to love her. 
My BF cries to this video every time. So do I. Get to see what it‚Äôs like to deal with this in his head vicariously through this video. 

Please don‚Äôt sexualize something just because you don‚Äôt understand how artists‚Äô create their art. This video was not made for that. It was made for healing, in my opinion.",2020-08-19T13:07:01Z,158

1. The guy represents sia herself and Maddie plays as sia's bipolar disorder. This one makes sense the most if u think about it.

2.the guy is the alcoholic father and maddie is his daughter who's trying to escape him.

3. I remember hearing maddie explaining it saying that she represents a wolf and the guy is the tamer, I heard this so long ago so correct me if I'm wrong.",2020-08-20T22:53:46Z,77

As she matures she realizes she doesnt have to continue that cycle of thinking and in turn is able to ""escape"" that cage. When she re-enters that cage it's because she wants to show.. perhaps her father whom she grew up with, that there was a way out of that cycle of pain and line of thinking but he is too old and stuck in his ways to be able to escape even though he recognizes he wants to.. super relatable to my life lol.",2020-09-07T16:47:58Z,0

"I know little of contemporary dance. I do know that focusing on the dance, the movements themselves are the goal. If you can, forget the difference in age or the fact one was male and one female. Dismiss that they are even human (the dance mimics animal behavior). I saw one ""being""  (shia) longing for connection, friendship, love... acceptance. The whole time, trying to win the others trust. The other ""being"" (maddie) a wounded soul who knows pain, is mistrustful, hesitant and fiercely defensive in her movements for most of the dance. I saw nothing sexual in the dance or movements. There was no lust conveyed to these eyes. At the end he had finally won her trust and she sees him for what he is...a friend, an ally. But the cage (society perhaps) will never allow them to be together and hence...the tragic ending. Fear of being alone drives most of us. I'm sure a large segment of the population can relate to this. It was beautiful.",2020-09-07T02:42:10Z,1

"The fact that people associate this with pedophilia or sexuality in general shows how twisted the internet has become. How can you even look at this an think of something sexual? I feel like something might be wrong with you if you can look at this and see anything sexual about it. People can share an intimate relationship without it being sexual, in this case it is the intimacy between father and daughter.",2020-03-03T12:35:30Z,2756

Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la
Yeah, no

Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila Sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la
Yeah

I love it when you call me Se√±orita

I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh I should be running
Ooh you keep me coming
For ya

Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say, ""We're just friends.""
But friends don't know the way you taste-la-la-la
'Cause you know it's been a long time comin'
Don't you let me fall, oh

Oh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop

I love it when you call me Se√±orita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh I should be running
Ooh you know I love it

When you call me Se√±orita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh I should be running
Ooh you keep me coming
For ya

All along I'll be coming for ya (for ya)
And I hope it meant something to ya
Call my name I'll be comin' for ya (comin' for ya)
Comin' for ya (comin' for ya)

I love it when you call me se√±orita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la, yeah

I love it when you call me se√±orita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me se√±orita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la la la
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't you let me fall, oh
Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop
I love it when you call me se√±orita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me se√±orita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
All along I've been coming for ya
And I hope it meant something to ya
Call my name, I'll be coming for ya
Coming for ya, coming for ya, coming for ya
For ya (oh, she loves it when I come)
For ya
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

"[Intro]
""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings.""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance."" (Six minutes‚Äî Six minutes‚Äî)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it."" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances.""
""You are just what the doc ordered.""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Œô have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run‚ÄìD.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""‚Äîthat's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause‚Äî

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton‚Äîno, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""‚Äî'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard‚Äîbe a king? Think not

I wanna know.
Am I losing my mind,
Never let me go.

apart but still together,
I know I'm not alone.

Wanna feel one last time,
take my pain away.

"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's goin' off about somethin' that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
""Hey, isn't this easy?""
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what you doin' with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standin' by and waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby
You belong with me
You belong with me

Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standin' by and waitin' at your back door

turn your magic on
Umi she‚Äôd say

and we are legends every day
that‚Äôs what she told me

turn your magic on,

everything you want‚Äôs a dream away
under this pressure under this weight

now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
and I feel my heart beating
oh you make me feel
like I‚Äôm alive again
alive again
oh you make me feel
like I‚Äôm alive again

said I can‚Äôt go on, not in this way
I‚Äôm a dream that died by light of day
gonna hold up half the sky and say
only I own me
and I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
oh I can feel my heart beating
cause you make me feel
like I‚Äôm alive again
alive again
oh you make me feel
like I‚Äôm alive again

turn your magic on, Umi she‚Äôd say
everything you want‚Äôs a dream away
under this pressure under this weight
we are diamonds taking shape
we are diamonds taking shape

if we‚Äôve only got this life
this adventure oh then I
and if we‚Äôve only got this life
you get me through
and if we‚Äôve only got this life
in this adventure oh then I
want to share it with you

yeah I do

I can still remember the synthesizer that was keeping her up all night, waking me up half in half an hour until 3 to 8 A.M. every morning. :D She was... 67 - because she never had the pleasure to celebrate her 68th birthday on 4 May 2019... she died in the silent night on 4th January 2019, and yes, I know this is late to say, but with all this quarantine thing, I found the occasion to share this memory of her and my life with you.

The same people who are like ""ew everythings so sexual and gross now theres so much skin being shown"" are the same people who are like ""I wish it were like the old days where no one showed skin."" but news flash; back then there was more nudity than ever, but the human body wasbt sexualized. There were naked statued everywhere. So YOURE the problem, YOURE the one sexualizing the human body, YOURE the ones shutting down art. Shame on you.",2020-08-23T17:51:26Z,564

"Many of us blame her for being naked but doing so is ignoring it's symbolism. 
Being naked she is trying to potray a symbol of purity, an untained person who is madly in love but is hurt tremendously and remains unaccepted by the person she loves.
You should understand the concept...",2020-05-06T06:21:00Z,3663

she always was and is the most open-minded artist of our generation but she had to take so much shit from millions of terribly close-minded haters.

Bad Bunny, baby, beb√©
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh
Yeah
Todos est√°n pendiente a ti (wouh)
Pero t√∫ puesta pa' m√≠ (aj√°)
Haciendo que me odien m√°s (yeh-yeh-yeh)

Porque todos te quieren probar (ah)
Lo que no saben es que no te dejas llevar de cualquiera
Y todos te quieren probar (nah)
Lo que no saben es que hoy yo te voy a buscar (yeh-yeh)

Dile que t√∫ eres m√≠a, m√≠a
T√∫ sabes que eres m√≠a, m√≠a
T√∫ misma lo dec√≠as
Cuando yo te lo hac√≠a
yeh, dile que t√∫ eres m√≠a, m√≠a
T√∫ sabes que eres m√≠a, m√≠a
T√∫ misma lo dec√≠as
Cuando yo te lo hac√≠a
Yeh yeh yeh yeh

Beb√©, yo soy fan de tu caminar (¬°wouh!)
Te doy todo lo m√≠o, hasta mi respirar (yeh)
Contigo veo todo como en espiral (yeh)
Quiero tirarnos fotos y que se hagan viral (ja)
Tus ojos me concentran como Adderall (¬°wouh!)
Contigo me sube el overall (yeh)
Te toco y hasta el mundo deja de girar
A nosotros ni la muerte nos va a separar (nah)
Beb√©, yo soy tuyo na' m√°s (na' m√°s)
Diles que conmigo te vas (¬°wouh!)
Que dejen de tirarte (prr)
Que a ti nadie va a tocarte

Dile que t√∫ eres m√≠a, m√≠a
T√∫ sabes que eres m√≠a, m√≠a
T√∫ misma lo dec√≠as (t√∫ misma lo dec√≠as)
Cuando yo te lo hac√≠a (cuando yo te lo hac√≠a)
yeh, dile que t√∫ eres m√≠a, m√≠a
T√∫ sabes que eres m√≠a, m√≠a
T√∫ misma lo dec√≠as (t√∫ misma lo dec√≠as)
Cuando yo te lo hac√≠a (cuando yo te lo hac√≠a)

Yo soy tu Romeo, pero no Santo (no)
A estos bobos con la forty los espanto (plo-plo)
Muchas me quieren desde que yo canto (jah)
Pero yo soy tuyo na' m√°s (¬°wouh!)
Yo soy tu Romeo, pero no Santo (yeh)
A estos bobos con la forty los espanto
Muchas me quieren desde que yo canto (aj√°)
Pero yo soy tuyo na' m√°s (¬°buh!)
Dile que t√∫ eres m√≠a desde la high (desde la high, yeh)
El yerno favorito de tu mai (de tu mai)
El capo que ten√≠a todas las Jordans y las Nike (y las Nike)
Dile a estos bobos que dejen de darte like (de darte like)
Quiero otra noche entera
Pa' recordar los tiempos en la escalera (escalera)
Dile que yo no soy cualquiera
Yo soy tu primero, t√∫ eres mi primera, yah yah

Porque todos te quieren probar (aj√°)
Lo que no saben es que no te dejas llevar de cualquiera (no no no no)
Y todos te quieren probar (¬°wouh!)

Pero que hora son, qu√© fue lo que paso

Yo no recuerdo, solo se que amaneci√≥
Y que tenia un tatuaje que dec√≠a ""Peace & Love""
Pero que confusi√≥n, creo que comet√≠ un error
Y mezcle los tragos y una pastillitas de color
Que sentimiento creo que tenia un medicamento
De esos que te noquean duro contra el pavimento
Ya son las 6 de la ma√±ana
Y todav√≠a no recuerdo nada
Ni siquiera conozco tu cara
Pero amaneciste aqu√≠ en mi cama

Pero que clase de rumba pa pa
Pa la que yo cog√≠ anoche que que que
No recuerdo lo que sucedi√≥
Y ya no me acuerdo de nada, no tengo nada en la mente
Solo que estaba tomando mucho ron con aguardiente
Rumbiando en la disco estaba prendido el ambiente
Ese es mi √∫nico recuerdo hasta donde estuve consciente
Se acababa la botella y de camino ya venia
J.Balvin me estaba hablando y no sabia lo que dec√≠a
Creo que nos presentaron, aun no lo se todav√≠a
Que no recuerdo tu nombre mala suerte la m√≠a
Ya son las 6 de la ma√±ana
Y todav√≠a no recuerdo nada
Ni siquiera conozco tu cara
Pero amaneciste aqu√≠ en mi cama
Ya son las 6 de la ma√±ana

"If you want it, take it
I should have said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore

I only want to die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

You were better, deeper
I was under your spell
Like a deadly fever, yeah, babe
On the highway to hell

I only want to die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

Thought of your body, I came alive
It was lethal, it was fatal
In my dreams it felt so right
But I woke up every time
Oh baby

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free

"HALO LYRƒ∞CS

Remember those walls I built
Well, baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you win
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo

You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again

But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again
Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
The risk that I'm taking

I'm never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away


I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
Halo, halo

Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'

Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave will you hold my hand?

Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look, gain some self control
And deep down I know this never works
But you could lay with me so it doesn't hurt

Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

"My mom died from a selfinflicted gun shot wound to the brain she died instantly on October 25th 2015 i was only 9 years of age and i was in the house at the time she died. I remeber running doen stairs and seeing my mother lying on the floor in a puddle of blood, i remember me trying to push her on her back so i could hug her for the last time even though she died instantly... my clothes were covered in my mothers blood. But two minutes later my moms friends walks into the door and seeing me on the floor hugging my mother she called 911 immediately then she tryed to pick me up but i never let go of my mother the police  had to take me off of my mother and i just broke down in tears then i hugged the police officer 

I cant believe i went through this when i was only nine years old. My mom never had depression or any type of syptoms it was just a lethal action and now i have to live with that memory and i still have the clothes that were soaked in my mothers blood and i will never give them away or take a trillion dollars for it.

But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man

'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

No, it's not a good look, gain some self control
And deep down I know this never works

Child is slowly taken

With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head they are crying

"After everyone's last breath on earth, the soul (spirit) goes to a new place; that's either Heaven or Hell. 
How is heaven? heaven is a very good place with no sins, sorrows, crying, lust, greed; in other words there is no sin there and it‚Äôs full of joy.

How is hell? Matthew 13:50 (UKJV) ‚ÄúAnd shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.‚Äù Hell is very terrible and it‚Äôs very very hot, you can‚Äôt survive placing your hand on a hot stove for 10 seconds, don‚Äôt even think you will withstand burning there without being consumed,
The thing here is you will be burned without being consumed in hell the same same way you boil a hard rock in water you will be there for eternity,
Again after judgement you will be thrown in lake of fire forever. 

Hell is a place of suffering from intense tormenting, so why choose to go there instead of going to Heaven? 

Here is the steps you must read, understand and believe in order to be sure you will be on your way to Heaven. 

Salvation
Jesus said, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me"" (John 14:6). He also said, ""I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved"" (John 10:9, NASB). Jesus is not only the way to heaven, he is also the door to heaven. 
Realise you are a sinner; Isaiah 64:6 (UKJV) But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses(the quality of being morally right) are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.

Deserving hell for sins
Realise that you deserve hell for your sins; 
Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH.¬†In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit.¬†They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later.¬†Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12).¬†Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are¬†not¬†the same.¬†Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead.¬†The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15).¬†All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at¬†The Great White Throne of Judgment¬†and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.¬†

Repent
So repent, Repenting means: to change your mind; a sincere turning away, in heart, mind and action; Therefore God wants you to repent of sinful values and of sinful living. God wants you to decide to follow Him and to make Jesus the Lord of your life.

No other way 
If you want to go to heaven, you've got to go through the door marked ""Jesus Christ."" There is no other entrance. 
By no other entrance it means belief in gods, Buddha, Muhammad or other beings or objects cannot save you; But only belief in Jesus Christ our Lord can save you.
No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus did for you as simple as that. Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Believe 
All you need to do is to truly believe with your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ suffered and got crucified and shed his blood for your sins at the cross, He was buried but rose again on the third day just to prove he was God and now alive in heaven. After that you will receive the holy spirit and you will know that you are going to heaven after death or when Jesus comes back while you are still alive.

After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c. 
As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life. Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag.",2020-09-08T14:42:06Z,0

"The sad thing about this song is its message is lost. This song was inspired by the death of young protestant childen in Britain who were murdered during the northern Ireland troubles. Although Dolores was Catholic Irish, she made this song in opposition to political aggression whether it's the Irish Republican forces, or the British Unionist forces. The point is there is only right and wrong, good and bad, both of which knows no sides. As an Irish man I pray that one day we all understand this message of unity (not as an island but as compassionate human beings for one another),  instead of the narcissistic exploitation of compassionate points wasted on social media. I don't care who officially owns land, we are all one and the same. RIP Dolores o'riordan",2020-08-10T01:43:27Z,8061

"This is a brilliant example of strong lyrics and despreate message for peace. The horrors and remanent trauma of this war, now that's a powerfull and moving theme for a mainstream song. 
I wish we had more of this in the actual pop/rock scene. There's still some bands writing deep and serious lyrics like that  of course, but politics seem to move more and more to the alternatives and more underground productions now.

Hush, don't speak
When you spit your venom, keep it shut, I hate it

"Video Explanation :                                     
The music video is about a Bolivian üáßüá¥ legend that tells the story of a deaf boy who fled from his abusive home and found a stray dog üêï that accompanied him since then. After living on the streets. He discovers that he has the special ability of perceiving troubled people - which he can heal by screaming (screaming that its said to be as loud as an earthquake and a tornadoüå™)

One day, he finds an old man who was being stoned by villagers while being taunted and ridiculed (hence why the old man has a dusty face) the boy intervened and by screaming, he resolved the situation and revived the old man‚Äôs heart (in the video, by buying him a new heart).

Old man and kid later meet a disfigured man who was abused, and was considered a leper by society (Called Kusillo in Bolivia). The disfigured man reveals that he is a prophet who was cursed by the devil üëπ (El Tio) because he didn‚Äôt worship him anymore and abandoned the town where the demon resided. 

üëπ El Tio is considered the lord of the underworld, to whom mortal people offer gifts in exchange for protection, or to ease his anger. 

The prophet (masked man) said anybody who could hear the demon would fall under his controlüåÄ. He told them that the demon could be found across a desert (Uyuni salt flats), where there was a town where people worshipped el tio üëπ - and the story said that el tio cursed the people in that town to kill themselves.

Together they start the journey to find the town, and arrive at a mine where the demon üëπ resided but they knew that everybody with their hearing intact could be cursed by el Tioüëπ or be directed to kill each other. 

That is why boy had to face the demon  alone and over voice him with his scream to stop him from cursing others.(the ultimate sacrifice - and why the two man and the dog left- to avoid getting under el tio üëπ control üåÄ)

The video has an open ending, considering that El Tio is the lord of the underworld who rules in the mines, and miners usually sacrifice a llama as a tribute from time to time to avoid being cursed. Sadly the boy could be seen as a big sacrifice to redeem the miners from El Tio‚Äôs undesirable influence.  
I‚Äôm Bolivian and love this story üáßüá¥

"LYRICS
Have you got color in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you (crawlin' back to you)
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few? (had a few)
'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy)
Busy bein' yours (bein' yours)
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
(Do I wanna know?) Too busy bein' yours to fall
(Sad to see you go) Ever thought of callin', darlin'?
(Do I wanna know?) Do you want me crawlin' back to you?",2020-08-25T17:23:59Z,581

'Cause I always do ('Cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (Maybe I‚Äôm too busy)
Busy bein' yours (Bein' yours)
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you‚Äôd stay

"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
Wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far

It doesn't even matter
I had to fall

"""Cheerleader (Felix Jaehn Remix)""

[Verse 1:]
When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she stays strong
Yeah, yeah
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say

[Pre-chorus:]
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
I'm like no, not really 'cause

[Chorus:]
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Verse 2:]
She walks like a model
She grants my wishes
Like a genie in a bottle
Yeah, yeah
'Cause I'm the wizard of love
And I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say

[Pre-chorus:]
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
I'm like no, not really 'cause

[Chorus:]
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge:]
She gives me love and affection
Baby, did I mention
You're the only girl for me
No, I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too
She thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do
Is just for me to pop the question

[Chorus:]
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her",2020-08-20T15:48:08Z,78

"It‚Äôs the summer of 2016:

-Every thing was good

- Memes were about Trump and other things

- You got to watch the Olympics (Rip 2020 Olympics)

- Pok√©mon Go was the biggest app ever at the moment, and everyone was talking about it

- You hung out with your friends everyday, had sleepovers and rode your bikes everywhere and went over to your friends pools to go swimming.

- There were legendary songs being played right now (like this song).

- Life was a lot simpler back then, now your in High School doing countless hours of homework, studying for tests, and getting sleep deprived. 


I just wanna go back to these times where I was worried if I wasn‚Äôt going to see all of my friends over the weekend, and not if my grades are high enough to get into the colleges that I want to go to.

I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
All my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize

Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

I'd die for you
That's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them
A bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically I'm the man
But literally I don't know what I'd do
I'd live for you
And that's hard to do
Even harder to say
When you know it's not true
Even harder to write
When you know that tonight
There are people back home which are talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're forming like
Who would you live for?
Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
Help me
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much

Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time
Taking my time on my ride
Oh, oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my

I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)

"Lyrics
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
All my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize
Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride
I'd die for you
That's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them
A bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically I'm the man
But literally I don't know what I'd do
I'd live for you
And that's hard to do
Even harder to say
When you know it's not true
Even harder to write
When you know that tonight
There are people back home which are talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're forming like
Who would you live for?
Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?
Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
Help me
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much
Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time
Taking my time on my ride
Oh, oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my
I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)

"Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely""
Once I was seven years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely""
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream, like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old

(Lukas Graham!)

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once I was twenty years old

Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother, I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life, and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon I'll be sixty years old

Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon I'll be sixty years old

Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely""
Once I was seven years old

Por qu√© ser√°
Por qu√© a m√≠
Ye
No te puedes ir sin contestar esa pregunta
Qu√© es lo que quieres
Qu√© necesidad es la que tienes
Para seducirme otra vez
Besarme otra vez
Volverme a poner el mundo al rev√©s
Pa' besarte como ayer
Sentirte otra vez
Me vuelves a poner el mundo al rev√©s

De solo verte me dan ganas de viajar al pasado y rescatar
Esos momentos que t√∫ y yo compartimos
Las ganas de rumbear
Eran noches de nunca terminar
Viv√≠amos en una fantas√≠a, pero era real
Lo que sentimos
Lo que hicimos
La casualidad que nos quedamos en la misma disco
Aprovechemos que nos vimos
Lo que sentimos
Lo que hicimos
La casualidad que nos quedamos en la misma disco
Dale mami que nos fuimos

Besarme otra vez
Volverme a poner el mundo al rev√©s
Pa' besarte como ayer
Sentirte otra vez
Me vuelves a poner el mundo al rev√©s
Como ayer
Hoy vuelve a aparecer bajo la luna llena, sirena
Precisamente en Cartagena
D√©jame, revivir esto es un placer
Baila que la noche es tuya, que el ritmo influya
Ponle picante, que el amor fluya
Y nos dimos cuenta que no hab√≠a un final
Esto no tiene por qu√© terminar
Lo que sentimos (mamacita)
Lo que hicimos
No es casualidad que nos quedamos en la misma disco
Aprovechemos que nos vimos
Lo que sentimos (mamacita)
Lo que hicimos
No es casualidad que nos quedamos en la misma disco
Dale mami que nos fuimos

"SELPINK 2.0, ICE CREAM REDO

For those BLINKs that are not informed, I'll clarify the goals of BLACKPINK big fanbases from Twitter. Since the first 24 hours release of Ice Cream, we were distracted by solo stans/akgaes and filled that day with negativities. In a result, they planned to redo the collaboration. BLINKs will act like as if SELPINK is coming again. Act like we didn't know the song and lyrics. Act like it was the day when the teasers are slowly coming up. Act like it was August 28 again. We'll stream and hype like it was the first release. We'll welcome the song without complaints and enjoy it just how BLACKPINK loves this song. The set date would be September 2, 8AM KST. The teasers will be released tomorrow.

Don't care what you got in your pocket

Flip that thang thang don't stop it
Wanna I just bang bang and pop it
While the club crowded just watch you (work it out)

Got a gang of cash and it's goin' all on the bar (now work it out)
And it's going fast 'cause I feel like a superstar (now work it out)

And all my people with me, I trust
Holdin' down for my city
If they askin' you, I'm not guilty
Only thing that I'm guilty of is making you rock with me (work it out)

"Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Times forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know (know)
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Times forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me
That's OK, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat
Where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's OK, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost
Back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home""

"THIS LOOK OF HIS WAS AN F'n FASHION MOMENT around the world. As some1 who is not from the western world i can tell u 4 a fact of his impact as a Megastar . Rarely do we copy a specific style of an artist from that world but we have done it for other icons like James  brown, M.J,  John Travolta' (grease look) .And it says so much abt chris and his impact as an artist around the world, not 2 mention his murals and quotes from his songs plastered along walls. But I still can't believe that in this day and age some1 can have an effect like that with Social media and everything. NATO children when i tell u chris made people in  the rest of the world dress up like him. He did his thing! .It's like they say Imitation is a huge form of flattery & c.b has millions of ppl that impersonate his fashion style,music, dancing style(z acrobatics) . When this video came out ,it became a unisex look and they copied him from the hat , to the leather jacket with white T-shirt, to the black jeans with a colorful shirt tied around their  waist and down to the timberland shoes. Like it was & still is a fashion look. What is crazy  is that, it's when u see artist like Brown that makes u realize and takes u aback that these artists really can affect the day 2 day lives of ppl around  the world. Congrats  on the Billi keep shining even brighter.",2020-09-06T19:40:05Z,12

You inspired so many people even if you don't know it,showing us that our health must be a priority. You are like a Phoenix.We know leaving 1D wasn't as easy as media says it was and I'm sorry for what mean people said to you,but we were,are and always be here for you.You were mature and knew that craziness must stop,so you left.We didn't understand that making 5 albums in 5 years wasn't normal,thinking just that you were having fun and we're sorry we didn't see it earlier. You had courage to fight for what is right and we couldn't be more grateful to stan someone like you. One Direction isn't just a boy band.. One Direction helped us learn how you can love and care about someone who doesn't even know you. We are a family and, I repeat, we will always be there for you.  Thank you for all that you've done and we hope that you're happy.  Love you, Dj Malik.‚ù§",2020-09-09T07:02:02Z,8
